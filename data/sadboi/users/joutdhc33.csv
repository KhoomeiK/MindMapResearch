depression,eydvsv8,t3_cwl19g,1567025382.0,i feel the same way & it sucks.....i have my reasons (as im sure most people do.) But just try to hang on to whatever hope you have. A tiny candle can eliminate the dark!  Also always be aware that it depression is usually either circumstantial/situational....or a chemical imbalance in the brain....  & you have to believe it won't last forever! Feel better
