alcoholism,fqk7ovs,t1_fqjkkd9,1589421736.0,"I stated above AA is not for me, but thank you. I realize the risks of being in a new relationship when Iâ€™m still having issues. I discussed this with my boyfriend when we first talked about being in a relationship and told him I needed time to heal. I am healing and speaking to a therapist. Iâ€™ve never argued with him before until just recently because of the incredible amount of stress Iâ€™m under working as an essential at Trader Joeâ€™s. If anything, he helps me feel better and helps me with my healing. I really donâ€™t want to give up on someone I love and who loves me just because Iâ€™m having issues. I know it would hurt him very deeply. ðŸ˜ž"
