extroverts,fin1fg7,t3_f8myqr,1582553354.0,"I empathise with this situation and it feels very familiar to how I felt a few years ago. 

The way I combat this is search for hobbies that help me lose time, be creative and physical. This took a lot of trial and error and I am still learning but it helps a lot. I take myself out to coffee and read. I got into leathercraft and I also walk at my nearby river. I've also gotten back into swimming. Podcasts are also really good becuase they give you a sense of ""company"" . The last thing I am looking to find is a community based hobbies- something I can do regularly with a group of people.

It's a pretty long journey and your tastes will change, but don't give up. Just keep moving forward. 

In terms of the relationship stuff just keep meeting new people. Don't worry about finding the next perfect relationship, just create more stories in your life by spending time with others.

You're self aware enough to be asking questions, so you'll be okay I think 😊"

AskRedditAfterDark,f8ihiw9,t1_f8gtzd0,1574588869.0,"Hey. I wanted to reply to this because I've been where you are. My depression was similar, it robbed me of a 'future'. I felt for a long time that there was no point to anything in life and that being happy was just something I wouldnt achieve. I would just think that it was all so draining and useless. I thought I was useless. Suicide for me just left like a means to an end. Not necessarily ending my 'pain' but just an ending altogether. Why keep going if Im just gonna be miserable right? I hated myself too and those thoughts I had. For 2yrs I just existed. I made appearances and I showed up where I could. 

I won't preach to you but  If I can offer anything to you, it's this. You are allowed to feel this way and you aren't alone. I never thought I would get through that period of my life. I didn't want to. I saw a psychologist and my GP becuase deep down I knew I wasn't supposed to feel this way. I went on mild anti-depressants for a year (even though I was against drugs for years thinking I could fight this). They really helped. It was a low dose but I could genuinely feel my self-talk shift to a kinder voice, one with patience and compassion. But it wasn't just drugs that helped. 

Throughout that year I did my best to invest time in myself. I tried new hobbies, I met new people. I took time off to reconnect with nature and I talked with people I trust and my psych. It took time, but not an impossible amount of effort. Your mind and body wants to be happy.

To this day it's still a challenge at times. I still fuck up and feel down. I even sometimes have suicidal thoughs pop up, but I know how to handle them now. I know that it's just my brain having a moment of weakness.

The thing about depression is, it's a liar. You trust that voice in your head ( which is often shaped by others)  becuase it's the only one you know. But with time, professional help and a little effort you can teach that voice to be kinder, more understanding and helpful.

This random Redditor believes in you. Things can get better."

It's really important to remember that this is and always will be - her fight. We as freinds can only help to.a certain point, so please make sure you look after your own emotional well being. My ex was heavily effected by her ED and it is what ultimately ended our relationship because I was giving too much of myself to try to ""help"".

What you can do is gently remind her that you are there is she needs help, but that you're not going to try to fix her. I don't know your friend like you do, but sometimes being upfront about things can be the easiest solution. Ask her how she is finding things with her ED but say that if she doesn't want to talk she doesn't have to- only that you asked because you care.

Also there is a great deal of information so read what you can. But be mindful that it's still not your responsibility.  Don't take on more than you need to."

It's also really good that you're seeing a professional to help with your issues. Even if you go thru a few more that's okay, you have to find one that you like that will also help you.

I've been where you are and it's a really isolating place. But in all honesty if you want your current relationship to survive you need to put focus on that. As it's been stated she's an ex for a reason. Maybe she was too short - or maybe height has nothing to do with it! You have to give some agency to your boyfriend too. He wants to be with you, you aren't forcing him haha. That's powerful stuff. Plus he's probably grown and learnt from that relationship and now you get the better and improved version. Boyfriend 2.0

And right now you're at a crossroads where you can become Lady 2.1 by growing from this, focusing on yourself worth (because you are worthy) or continue down this path of self-hatred and end up at Lady 1.8 

Or something like that. 

If you can try to be more gentle to yourself, you deserve love and care. Position yourself to see your height as a positive. Height is powerful! That's some Amazonian Goddess stuff right there. Some girls would kill to be taller. 

Most of all know that you'll be okay. All humans are insecure about something, but you'd be surprised by how many ignore it or are not doing anything to fix it. You're making an effort. Good on you.

Some of my closest friends and my ex were are survivors of serious sexual trauma.

The thing I have learned over the years is that they really just want someone to listen. 

And just that.

As men we are hard wired to want to help ""fix"" these situations, but we can't. It's difficult to hear these things and it's painful for us to a degree, but it pales in comparison.

If she tells you more just explain that her feelings are acknowledged and that you are thankful she shared this with you. That  you care about her and you will be there for her is she want to talk it out. 

Don't ask her why she was there or why she didn't fight it or do something differently etc. Don't ask what she was wearing or what she did for it to happen. Don't ever make her feel like she was doing something wrong.

It is NEVER the victims fault. Period. Full stop. 

It's a sad reality but this is so commonplace, but what's worse is a man trying to ""mansplain"" someone out of their trauma.

With regards to intimacy I can say that its different for everyone. Just always be vocal and check in. 

Disassociation is a real thing so please research the warning signs and always look for vocal and congitive ongoing consent."
