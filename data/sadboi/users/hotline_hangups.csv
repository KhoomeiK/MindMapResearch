I have had a very mild version of this experience, and even that definitely did a number on me. I feel like with tragedies, it's so horribly easy to convince yourself you are responsible, even if it's clearly not your fault. Your mother ENSURED you felt that way, and that is beyond monstrous. 

When my younger sister was an infant, she suffered a bad head injury. (I didn't know this until adulthood, but the person who was supposed to be watching her let her out of their sight.) I was in first grade, and my friend and I were swinging in a tandem swing (sort of like a box where two kids sit opposite each other and the whole thing swing back and forth) in my backyard. Little sister wandered into the path of the swing. It whacked her super hard on the head. She fell down, got up, and got knocked back down again before I managed to stop the (fuckin heavy) swing. It happened so fast. Within minutes she had a massive goose egg on her forehead. Obviously everyone freaked the fuck out. Hospital etc. Because she was just a baby we had no idea what would happen as she grew up. 

Sure enough, afterwards, throughout her childhood, she had unexplained and persistent health problems. We saw...oh, so many doctors. Every time we met a new specialist my parents would reference this event, as in ""maybe this is the reason"". Every time they brought it up I felt such terrible guilt. Until I was well into my teens, they always talked about ""the bump"" as the primary suspect, even after doctors diagnosed the real cause. Now it's evolved into a bit of a family joke. Ha, ha..

(Disclaimer!! I absolutely adore my family and I am 1000% sure they didn't realize I felt guilty about this- i doubt I would have made much a production out of my guilt, not wanting to call further attention to the hideous possibility I shortened my sister's life. They obviously were not blaming me. They probably wouldn't have imagined I blamed myself, because logically, of course I wasn't responsible.)

Luckily she is fine today- but for most of her childhood we didn't know what was wrong, we were all scared, and that secret guilt really warped me as a person. As an adult I realize (of course!!) that I had very little control over the swing, the whole thing happened in the blink of an eye, and obviously my parents were blaming ""the bump"", ie the incident itself, not ME, personally. But I was too young to understand the distinction. By the time I WAS old enough, I'd fully internalized the guilt.

All of this is just to say, I have experienced a TINY FRACTION of what your mom put you through, and it was awful. I respect what you've survived. Best of luck on your way to healing, friend, and I'm so sorry for your many losses.

Tldr; until I was nearly an adult I thought I had permanently wrecked my baby sisters health"

The jokes are actually funny and the scenes where things explode actually make you go 'holy shit' like they're supposed to. Dialogue is perfectly balanced and nothing feels cliche. 

More importantly to me... the theme throughout the show with Kipo's self-realization is relevant to so many lives. The show celebrates being different, like, actually different, where people point and stare and are rude. It celebrates putting yourself out there to defend the dignity and validity of your friends.

I've been studying the pattern on a few sites for a couple years now. The sheer volume on Reddit is fascinating and scary. Given that so many of these posts are throwaways, I don't believe karma is the motive. Yet someone is cranking these out day in and day out. Usually there are pockets of posts around a specific issue, and one will get to #1 on any given day. 
Ultimately I think someone is running the numbers and studying which topics are the most controversial on a variety of social media websites. These posts are not written by amateurs- they're getting more sophisticated over time as the boundaries of what reddit's culture will accept are being intricately mapped. The same thing is happening on various communities on Facebook, and I've followed similar mass troll activity on Twitter. I kinda think of it as the Disingenuous Horde.

Either way NTA but I think you should talk to your friend in a different way before taking the extreme route. like, I know people like this. I was a person like this, for a minute. Since the absolutely true fact ""this is super unhealthy"" hasn't moved him, I'd approach him using stoner logic.

1) don't present him with an ultimatum. you're just a friend... parentifying yourself will alienate him
2) tell him that watching him faint reeeally kills the vibe and makes everyone super worried for him, and his reassurances won't work because he can't see himself from the outside
3) ask if he's actually TRYING to have a 'green out' or if it's an accidental thing when he overdoes it 
4) inform him he's probably maxed out his tolerance if he has to smoke to seizure before he feels something, and therefore
5 tell him you ALL need a T break
6) finally ask if he'd maybe consider switching methods to something that allows you more control over intake

It is possible to get addicted to weed and he's fucking with the only brain he has. So I take this very seriously. Still, this is my realistic advice from personal experience. If he doesn't want to see a doc, he won't. Convincing him to change might be a matter of convincing him he's forgotten what being properly high is like, as people tend to do when they stop moderating their intake."

I'm not sure how or why it happens but essentially I have a tiny pun-and-reference-finder in my head. The quips shoot out before I can stop myself, straight-up bypassing my common sense filters. So I can sympathize with your situation, but you clearly did have time to think and consider your response. Your ""wait, should I not?"" mechanism never kicked in.

Here's how I would handle it. I would run-not-walk to apologize to the guy. And if it's not too late, I suggest saying that you didn't read his comment closely, and that if you had been paying closer attention you never would have made light of the situation. Say you're embarrassed and crucially, say you're very sorry for what he's going through. Maybe make a payment for him. Kidney failure is excruciating and isolating. He's hurting.

In the future, maybe do what I do and make a checklist of no-go zones - what I think of as roomfucker topics. Once certain topics come up, even if they are not the target of the potential joke, the room has been fucked. It's a bad audience now. Joke won't fly. Imminent death, especially of someone in the conversation itself, will fuck up a room instantly.

But the important thing here is comedy is supposed to make people feel better, not just make you look clever. You made a dying guy feel bad. So even if you don't care about this dude, I feel you should make amends in the spirit of comedy. Think of it like this. If you don't, one day *your* kidneys could fail. The gods of cosmic humor are cruel.

AmItheAsshole,ey1bfm6,t1_ey0ayun,1566695068.0,"And if we're talking ""free pass"" as in social consequences, I would suggest that having your entire life consumed by your disorder to the point where you hover near death and require years of inpatient care is enough.

That's what nags at me about the whole ""free pass"" thing - you don't have to accomodate or stand for the behavior, but it's not like they're being rewarded for it. 

On top of the actual effects of the disorder, being on the record as having been hospitalized for mental illness or disorder/addiction means you're at a disadvantage when it comes to basic stuff like your career, dealing with law enforcement/the court system, and finding unbiased healthcare - let alone maintaining a positive social reputation, which is the domain of the ""free pass"" in question. 

It's just such a weird thing to get hung up on when so much is at stake."

If you have veto power, she has veto power. Would you cede that to her? Or would you be annoyed and feel controlled?"
