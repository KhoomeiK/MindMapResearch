But I will follow it up by saying that I *should* have worded my reply comment not as you’re condescending, but as what you said is condescending. I can’t attest to whether you’re a condescending person and it wasn’t right of me to make that leap. My apologies."
SmolBeanSnark,fqtzlew,t1_fqtywpy,1589649145.0,"Its always translated as pretty condescending to me to use a pet name in a disagreement, so while I’m not willing to concede on that point I will just reiterate that I think you’re right!"

I appreciate your perspective and can definitely see where you’re coming from/agree that rather than have a large group of people conform to what my idea of appropriateness is, it would just make more sense for me to not engage. I genuinely hope you have a good day!"
SmolBeanSnark,fqtwcey,t1_fqtw0wh,1589647375.0,That makes sense! Thanks for clarifying. I admittedly know very little about the grading system for universities outside of the US.

SmolBeanSnark,fqtnruz,t3_gk3m45,1589642573.0,"I know this is a discussion thread so my apologies if this isn’t the best place to put this, but I’m horrified that her transcript got posted here. That, to me, goes beyond snarking and is an actual invasion of privacy and frankly, it’s creepy. I’m not trying to condemn the poster (I don’t remember who posted it), but this is definitely inappropriate. If anything it makes this community look bad and only adds fuel to her counter arguments and claims of bullying. Hell, if behavior akin to posting her transcripts has been being posted all along (I’m relatively new to this group) then I would go so far to say that IS bullying. I feel like nothing was gained by searching for and sharing her grades and I’m kind of ashamed to be associated with this ordeal even tangentially.

EDIT: I wanted to thank y’all for your responses below — definitely got more perspective on where everyone is coming from and I realize that it isn’t my place to police what’s discussed here."
SmolBeanSnark,fqr52m2,t1_fqr2gsu,1589577737.0,"Y’all forgive me if this isn’t cogent but this has me absolutely mind blown. This baking analogy is such an insult to actual SWers Im tempted to believe that she’s joking to stoke the fire. I refuse to believe that someone who is as educated as she is, regardless of what grade she did or did not get on her dissertation, cannot understand the multifaceted social, political, and economic barriers that actual sex workers face on a daily basis. While still having to be pleasant and sexy TO AFFORD TO LIVE. Not only that, but this is yet another example of a white woman being woefully uninformed and unapologetic about a social issue/their own bad behavior while those who actually face real life repercussions for the industry (AKA sex workers) they engage in are put in a position where THEY are educating HER! This is tone deaf and embarrassing. If her desire is to shock the public through performance art, this simply ain’t it, and it makes me think the only performance art shes consumed has been western and overwhelmingly white."

SmolBeanSnark,fqhyheh,t1_fqhxfv0,1589386782.0,"Adore your take on codependency as well — I agree with all of the above. I’d like to add, and I’m speaking only for myself, that I think part of the time partaking in this sub at all may even be a symptom of my own struggles with mental health. I’ve learned so much about myself from this sub though and find that there are many individuals who consume this media and metabolize it in a very smart and socially conscious, more meta way — I love the discussions that it can promote. I don’t know. It’s a thin line to walk."
SmolBeanSnark,fqhvqoo,t1_fqhu7u9,1589385439.0,"I love your last phrasing — I agree. I definitely got a sick sort of satisfaction from reading this post but that, at the end of the day, has nothing to do with Caroline and everything to do with the way I think about money, class, and my own self worth in relation to those two concepts. I think that when you say it isn’t sustainable, I would go one step further and say that it also is behavior that has the propensity for escalation. While I think we’re within our rights to observe what someone does and rightly criticize them for bad behavior, I think there’s something to be said for the fact that it’s becoming abundantly clear that this woman is really mentally ill and it’s starting to make me feel...yucky to even comment on what she does. Going on her page I feel the same way I did while watching Tiger King: it was fun and funny at first, but as the story wore on it became profoundly sad and depressing. Watching a train wreck in slow motion can only be entertaining for so long."

SmolBeanSnark,fq7vk65,t1_fq7hvao,1589153092.0,"Not rushing to her defense, but I have to say that completed suicide is considered the most politically correct way to say died by suicide — the phrase « committed suicide » can be construed as putting blame on the deceased. I get that this sounds new age-y, but for my former profession we went through MULTIPLE crisis response workshops and trainings and in each this was the language professionals employed. This was about 3 years ago, but to my knowledge this is still used today. If any of you know otherwise please let me know! I must say I think her use of the little squigglies around it was kind of...off putting (do y’all know the real name for the lil squigglies by any chance?) but her actual wording is sensitive especially considering her track record."
SmolBeanSnark,fq1vgvm,t1_fq1t4js,1589049943.0,"Honest to god I think she hypes Brigid up because she’s really intimidated by her beauty and is GENUINELY concerned about B getting more followers than her/becoming more successful than she is. Its a very roundabout way to keep yourself secure, much like keeps your friends close but your enemies closer. I also don’t doubt that if she does check this thread at all she saw the comments referencing All About Eve and that it put her on edge - I can say that from my own viewpoint, despite the fact that I think CC has lost it, I would feel similarly threatened. Nonetheless, it’s a slap in the face to her two previous assistants and I hope that they’re able to unpack however the situation makes them feel and move on to bigger and brighter things at jobs that respect them for more than their beauty can provide for their bosses’ image."

SmolBeanSnark,foid590,t1_fohwhi3,1587783900.0,"I agree you in many ways, and this is in no defense of her behavior, but I think in a more meta way that there is a sizable portion of Instagram influencers slash activists who seem to co-opt revolutionary language to suit their own individual needs. From my perspective, a lot of the concepts that they’re latching onto aren’t necessarily made for the individual, but rather the collective. In short, I think they’re taking principles of socialism and communism because those are considered edgy and appealing to a younger more alternative audience (especially in NYC)  and essentially putting a little capitalist bow on it and selling it to the masses. Altogether it’s definitely nefarious and hard to follow, but at its core it’s just a money making enterprise."
SmolBeanSnark,fohvk2x,t3_g735c1,1587773474.0,"Have y’all seen the latest Stella post ? I’d like to know your thoughts. I’m finding it incredibly interesting to watch CC change her narrative in real time to latch onto what gains her the most positive press, especially when you consider the times we’re living in now. I really wonder about the longevity of her work (or lack thereof, depending on your POV) she’s doing in a post-COVID world, not that any of us can necessarily conceive of what that will look like right now. All influencers and the like have really captured my attention since quarantining, if anything because while they are trite, we all seem to need the distraction so to speak."

birthcontrol,ffg9n29,t3_etg4un,1579901445.0,"I’ve never had the implant before, but I’ve had the non-hormonal copper IUD for just shy of a year. For background, I’m in my early 20s and have never been pregnant. I chose copper because I react poorly to hormones and I’ve been really happy with my choice. I won’t lie, getting it put in was quite painful but I also didn’t take ibuprofen beforehand nor did I think to ask my gyno for any numbing agent (mistake). I also drove myself to the appointment - I can’t stress this enough, but please don’t do this. I was nauseous afterwards and driving was SUPREMELY unpleasant. I got it put in on a Friday and stayed home for work, and by Monday morning I was only slightly uncomfortable. By the next week or so my body felt like it did before. My periods were heavier in the first three months following insertion, but have since evened out. I’ve always been someone who suffers from bad cramps on or off of birth control so I really did not notice any change in pain levels, and no other symptoms have cropped up. The only lasting change so far has been that now my period lasts 7 days instead of 5, with the last two days just being light spotting until it goes away altogether. All of that being said I would do it again in a heartbeat, pain and all - I never have to think or worry about it and it lasts for 10 years. I highly recommend."

AmItheAsshole,fbeea7k,t3_ecu3p4,1576783954.0,"It was really uncool of your friends to jump on you like that, but let me say from the absolutely bottom of my heart, YTA. You took what sounds like teasing really personally - I’m not blaming you, but couldn’t you have asked her to stop? Or have had a moment of vulnerability and admitted to your friends that they were hurting your feelings? Or simply removed yourself from the situation? As a woman I know that being a “prude” is perceived negatively, but I truly don’t think it’s comparable to the prejudice and shame that’s wrapped up in a positive STI diagnosis for all people regardless of gender identity. Id imagine that your friend feels rather awful about herself, and she was most likely mocking you as an effort to justify her own behavior or make herself feel better. This isn’t right, but it is in no way the same as telling everyone at the table that she has an STI. Also, “I did it without judging her at the time” is bullshit and you know it - you don’t sound like an idiot, OP. You wouldn’t have brought it up at the table if you didn’t have a negative bias towards her positive diagnosis."

AmItheAsshole,f78om4p,t3_dtg4jw,1573496234.0,"Controversial, but I’m going to say YTA here. While I understand that the situation must be frustrating, it sounds like your boyfriend is in no way interested in this girl and you really have minimal need to feel threatened by what amounts to a very one sided crush. Better to have preserved her feelings and your own reputation by speaking to her in a more private setting or allowing your boyfriend to set the record straight with her. Had you not said anything she would have embarrassed herself publicly by herself anyway."
