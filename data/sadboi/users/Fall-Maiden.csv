Got at least 20+ since I transitioned 4 years ago from there and they hold up reasonably well. 

Pro tip if your head is big like mine, steer clear of bands with teeth for grip or file them off, also away from metal ones that have decorations and catch your hair."

They probably won't dig too much into you being trans, or no more than is relevant to the sexual element of the counseling.

Just because this happened to me, do you mean to advance your transition? Because PS counselling is not the same as a GIC and your GP might not know that."
