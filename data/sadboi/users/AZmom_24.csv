If you take a look at the OP’s past posts you’ll see that her 14 year old daughter has had multiple past mental health issues. She’s been put on a  psych hold for a suicide attempt and has ran away from her father’s house before. My original suggestion was to stay with her daughter instead of going for a run in this quarantine time because it’s very obvious that the 14 year old needs constant parental supervision right now. Not for forever- thats just not healthy for anyone involved. It won’t be a permanent solution. Sorry if it came off that way."

Our homes have become classrooms for our children. Our homes have become a workplace for family providers. Our homes have become a space of solitary worship. Our homes have become a reservoir inventoried of supplies. Our homes have become a therapy space.   Our  homes have become a 24 hour restaurant. Our homes have become a gym area. And for some, our homes have become an ICU hospital unit; treating those dear to us that have been infected by the virus. The common denominator in all of this: home. YOUR family’s home. You are making a difference."
Parenting,flodv0t,t3_fpts91,1585336391.0,"A different perspective here from a parent with a child with special needs. Some children are non verbal and simply can’t communicate with  words to their parents, sibling, peers and strangers. I would love to have a conversation with my child about their interests, and are working towards those speech goals daily. 

Buttttttt, I AGREE, it does get old when little ones only want to discuss things are of interest to them. A suggestion: ask them to create a “fact book” or “encyclopedia” with words and illustrations of all of the important details. Hoping this keeps them occupied for a small time and then there can be a “fact sharing” time (an hour, 15 minutes- whatever your parental headspace can handle!) and that can be enough for the day! 

Young kids are still learning the art of conversation. Let them know- hey, you’ve been talking for quite awhile now about ________ topic, it’s my turn to talk about something I am interested in. Do you want to hear about the time mom/dad went to ________? Obviously discussing adult topic like politics, filing taxes, paying bills, favorite episodes of Law and Order, etc. aren’t appropriate, but it starts to implement the importance of listening skills. 

Also! It’s completely OK to let your children know that you’re not interested in listening to them at that exact moment and give them a timeframe to come back and talk to you. 

OP- This isn’t meant to downplay the frustration any parent feels (because it is REAL!), but simply offer a different perspective."

[here](https://hbr.org/2020/03/that-discomfort-youre-feeling-is-grief). Something that we, as persons with PTSD, closely identify with is the anticipatory grief feeling. Persons suffering from PTSD experience triggers that can bring on this anticipatory grief feeling and so for some of us, this has become a part of our daily routine as we try to adapt and push through to complete normal daily life functions. I hope that this can be shared with others to allow them to better understand the uneasiness that may be felt at this time. Although we are all far apart, I am with you."
