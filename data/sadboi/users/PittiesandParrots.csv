I'm against docking but seriously considered it for my pittie when her tail wagging caused the tip of her tail to bleed from hitting it against the wall. All bandages would be pulled off by her or other dog. It took 2 months to heal and once we figured out that putting bitter apple on the bandage would keep the dogs from picking at it we were good. I never wanted to dock my girl but if her injury hasn't healed I would have."

It also sounds like your childhood wasn't stable and you may not have the coping skills necessary to handle this rejection. I can't imagine how hard it is knowing you were given up and that your parents stayed together and had two more children while you were put into foster care.

I'm marrying a man next month who has 3 daughters and they have been involved in our relationship every step of the way.  They were there for the proposal, they are in the bridal party, and we did dress shopping together. I even had a kid-friendly portion to my bachelorette party so that the kids could participate.

Now that being said, maybe you aren't very close to your sister and so you don't feel the need to do this. But then you should bow out of the bridal party. It's the couple's day and if you are going to be in the party then they get to decide what you wear."

You are the adult and could have taken this opportunity as an olive branch and worked on building your relationship.
