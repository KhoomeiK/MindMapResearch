nosleep,flied9j,t3_fjma9t,1585180758.0,"So I have suffered with derealization disorder in the past, it was triggered by drugs. Once the drugs left my system, I thought I would go back to normal... I did not. For months. Nothing seemed real. I couldn’t even feel physical things with my hands or feet. It would feel as if my hands and feet were melting though space. I felt immense fear throughout all of this because I was going crazy. I was extremely paranoid and anxious. If I wasn’t having a panic attack, I was on the verge of one 24/7 for months. 

Certain things would trigger the derealization to get worse like staring at something for too long, hearing repetitive noises, thinking too much in my head, and other things. I can’t even describe what I felt and saw when things got worse. Anyway, it was like my sane self was stuck inside an insane persons body and mind. And there was nothing I could do about it. I could barely sleep because of all the extreme anxiety. Time went on forever. I was so close to killing myself. If it wasn’t for my faith, I would have done it. Living like that was pure hell, but if I thought that was hell, actual hell would be a infinitely worse...

So I laid in my bed for days only managing to get up to go to the washroom and drink water. Then one day I decided to let go of everything. I decided to accept my fate and succumb to insanity. Instead of fighting against having a panic attack, I just let myself get triggered. I had an out of body experience at this point. And again, it was indescribable and I can barely remember it. I just remember thinking I died. But I awoke like I was re-born, 

Still, it felt like nothing was real. But I wasn’t paranoid or anxious anymore. I just accepted that “nothing is real”. There’s no point in getting tripped up over what’s real and what isn’t. Just accept it all as reality and move on."

Caffeine is a diuretic so it makes you pee and doesn’t really count as getting liquid.

Water has no calories, it won’t make you gain fat. And with all the caffeine your drinking, you’re not going to retain so much water either. But either way, fluids push fluids. Water retention is only temporary if you’re dehydrated.

I just kind of force myself to drink water. Get a cute water bottle and always keep it with you to encourage you to drink more. Please be careful!"
