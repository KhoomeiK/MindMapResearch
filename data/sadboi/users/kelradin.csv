bipolar,ex0dy7g,t1_ewzjl5q,1565910675.0,"Okay, that makes a great deal of sense. Thank you!

What does DAE stand for? I didn't realize that the post wasn't actually made up or created by the person putting it on this subreddit (is that the correct term?). I also hasn't considered how anyone (depressed or otherwise) might get the wrong impression from this. Is the proper reddiquitte to delete my uninformed comments? Or let them be, and just tell you all here that you've convinced me I was not thinking this through very well earlier.

I am coming off of anesthesia from this morning, and maaaaybe I shouldn't be out here on the interwebs yet. I'm (probably pretty obviously) not entirely well, physically or brain-wise, to begin with. Reading about other people with psychological or neurological differences is the only thing that really helps me to think and feel things other than self pity, anxiety, and helplessness (and other crappy stuff not worth a mention). And it makes a big difference.

So when I saw this I thought it was utterly absurd to suggest that crippling depression might allow you to feel even slightly like you have any power, or let you feel unique or different in any kind of good way. That's why I find it hilarious. It's a jab at my pride, and it makes me feel lighter. But I understand what you wrote about jokes like this one needing to be in the right context, and I think it's a stronger point than any of mine. 

Thank you for explaining it so clearly and without hostility!! I'll watch out for that kind of thing now, and be more thoughtful with what I write. Maybe I need to stick to only reading for a couple days (or at least the rest of today!) and I'll learn to pick up on what you (and nearly everyone else) must have noticed immediately. Thank you again!!"
bipolar,ex07y7y,t3_cqq3oc,1565906733.0,"If you don't like something in this group/whatnot can't you just ignore it? If it doesn't amuse you, try touching your phone just right (oh yeah, Baby!). With a little luck (and the brain of a toddler) you can be looking at something you're sure to like before you can even get your pants in a proper twist! 

Oh, but the sweet-sweet power of the keyboard (or the finger I guess? if you're using a phone)... it sure is hard to walk away without having said (sorry, typed?) that last word. I hope we all know deep down that none of this whatnot matters.

Think if you could only complain or look at porn. Which would you choose? That's right, it doesn't matter. Because both are always an option (well maybe not üíØ all the time always, but üêª with me). We can probably agree that neither is going out of vogue any time soon.

Even when you're too exhausted from all the complaining (and porn surfing, you little rascal) (or if you don't happen to fancy either), you can muster a teeny effort, and voila!, you'll be apt to find something you like to do better than complain (I'm not saying the same about the porn here; I really don't know your life!)! 

Aaaaaaah yet and still, if a post You (chose to) read seems inappropriate or harmful, isn't it up to You to report the issue (per the app/whatnot usage agreement)?? Won't commenting on any post just flat make it more visible from the increased activity associated with the post? Websites/whatnots are constantly collecting data, right?

So logically, wouldn't you expose more app/whatnot users to any given post by commenting on it? Wouldn't the best thing be to either ignore or report? Or even try to step away? If some place is  particularly heinous in real life, do you stay there? These are honest questions; I'm trying to understand.

Nevertheless, in cases of extreme upset (trigger warning!!) we cry and blow our little whistles at each other like Nanny is peeking around every corner! If she's not there (or not nice, or hardly fit to run fast enough) to pat our little bums and prevent anyone ever hurting our special feelings, we feel deeply persecuted.

When I catch myself (which I certainly do!) with this entitled yet helpless line of thinking, I step away. If I can't sort out my feelings (or feel unsafe), I find a way to tell someone I trust that I need an adult. But don't take my word for it; I'm a stranger who cannot and should not matter in your life!

I'm pretty new to Reddit, and I've not gotten at all savvy yet. The bipolar ""groups"" (subreddits, right?) are the only reason I'm interested in learning how to function here. I've never had the opportunity to communicate with anyone who has even a vaguely similar set of diagnoses to mine. Seeing so many already... And how different we all are! How very clever/talented and funny most of us are! And just knowing that I can put my worst foot forward for once... priceless! 

We are ALL allowed to express any feelings, anytime, and any way we want! This is something I've had to relearn too many times. Please don't be confused. I'm not saying that you can verbally assault people, or that you can act outside of the user agreements or other types of contacts you voluntarily sign (or stand stark naked on your balcony screaming threats of impending doom at all your neighbors üò≥). You will always face the consequences of your decisions (unless you get off with some convincing insanity plea, and even then you will probably feel guilty/whatnot).

If I choose to laugh at something tragic, ugly, and irrevocably Fucked, I'm going to do it. And I'm not sorry. All I see here is art in the form of a clever joke and maybe some computer skills? Stuff like this OP offer just a bit of relief from facing so bravely up against reality for so long.

I've felt so alone for a long time. Whoever you are reading this, you may not understand what it feels like to lose yourself completely. Then to find yourself in a cold, numb shell of who you thought you were. Then to learn that you will never be the same. You may never even look the same. You may have hurt or lost someone that you will never have the chance to see or try to make things right with. You may even find that you've been fired or quit your job, blew through financial accounts and sexual partners faster than you can think (which I know is damn quick!), and you didn't even stop to smell the roses! 

Aw hell, you might not even believe you did half of the things you did, because you can no longer form memories the same old way everyone else can. But that doesn't matter either. I'd wager there are a few folks reading this who understand. 

But I hope not. I hope none of you have or ever will experience anything like that. But if you ever have, or are, or love someone who has or is... I hope there really is a way you can find others with similar pain. They help you learn how to cope. That part matters.

You are good people; brilliant!! Sorry for shitting up all over your post or whatever. I don't understand what that means yet. The original poster's lil memer thingy was not shitty, (and I enjoyed it) and I'm not talking shit here... Soooo, I remain contentedly confused about where the shit comes in to play. I can always call Nanny to clean it up, though she doesn't matter anymore either. And I feel much better when I figure out how to take care of my own affairs.

I like your sense of humor, OP (I think that's the right thing to call you)! If you feel any inkling, please drop me a line on the personal tip/whatnot. Maybe you'd consider trying to help me out with a little comedy project I'm working on... It might matter someday!

bipolar,ev5u3v2,t1_ev42yf3,1564238737.0,"Sidebar: You seem pretty lucid for someone who is unmedicated, if you don't mind me saying so. 

I haven't been unmedicated since my second severe manic episode. I was unmedicated for a year or so after being told my initial episode was a result of stress and my diagnosis wasn't correct. I was so glad I wasn't sick. I felt like they really had made a mistake. The doctor did some genetic testing and put me on a vitamin classified as a ""medical food."" I ditched all my old friends and kept to myself so I wouldn't get sick or stressed again. But I started to have problems with sleep... The anxiety meds that the doctor told me were like very strong Benadryl didn't help. Not even the old Klonopins I found in my nightstand let my mind slow enough to sleep. So I didn't sleep for a while. You might could guess where it went from there. After my second stint in a somewhat less traumatizing psych ward I had new doctor. It was a man this time, but I thought maybe he would do better than the first doctor. 

Three years of lithium, Klonopin, sleeping pills, and a host of often overlapping antipsychotics later I get my third p doc. She listens to me when I tell her I would like to have children, but I know that lithium would hurt my baby (if I can conceive). She told me it was possible, and worth trying. The sleeping pills were the first thing to go.

She slowly but steadily tapered the antipsychotics until I was only on Lithium, gabapentin, and Klonopin. I didn't want to take Klonopin when they gave it to me after my first episode. I know enough about benzos to want to stay away. The nurses in the psych ward told me they would strap me down and inject me with Ativan if I didn't take it orally. After I was released I felt a civic and moral obligation to comply exactly with my doctor's instruction. So I kept taking the Klonopin. And I didn't question any of the rest. Not even the Adderall to help me focus at work...or at least help me stay awake at work. 

I finally feel like I have a choice. I'm taking lamictal in lieu of lithium because it's safer for a potential baby. I take less than .5 mg of Klonopin a day. I'm currently tapering off the gabapentin under my doctor's supervision. No antipsychotics.

I'm voluntarily jumping off of Adderall today at 10mg. I think it's actually keeping me awake later than I want to be awake now. I used to pass out every night before 8. I was lucky to make it to bed if I didn't go right away. I was on 20mg of Adderall because I fell asleep at work and got singled out by my boss. I felt so guilty that I took what they told me to. Again. I have always known that I don't have ADD.  

Today I feel alive again. I feel like I have a personality now. I laugh. Actually laugh. I feel so free to be able to influence and choose what medicine I take. Even if it's just for now. I hope I don't go through any more benzo or amphetamine withdrawal. But if I know for sure it's temporary, I don't care how bad it gets. I won't hurt anyone including myself, no matter what. That means no one can make me take anything I don't need unless I get really hurt in some other way and they need to help me. No one.

I didn't know I had that right anymore.

I didn't know I had the right to contact my company's HR department confidentially. Even if I only suspect discrimination based on disability. I'm looking forward to discovering what other rights I have that I don't know about. But I'm going to try to sleep. Hopefully this hypomania will fade with the Adderall and I'll be able to write reasonable and far far less verbose comments.

Oh shit. Now my attempt to encourage you actually looks manic and stupid to me. Why am I telling you what to do, and how to feel? That can't be right... I honestly just want to encourage you to be yourself! I can relate.

I write on paper, like in notebooks or journals (or whatever's nearby), when I'm having Big ideas. I don't even show my writing to anybody. But when I find it later (and I'm invariably depressed - or just numbed out during the in-between of bipolar life), I almost always feel so ashamed and angry at myself that I destroy it. With tears and fervor. 

I'm sometimes afraid that in the end, I will look back at my life and see nothing but the jagged edges of ripped out ideas and pages of empty minded days.

I conclude that many people posting and reading on this thread are extremely thoughtful, highly considerate of others (most of the time), and terribly afraid of being misunderstood. But if this is the only safe place we can be ourselves, maybe we shouldn't delete and over edit and care so much about saying this just right. Maybe the things we're deleting world have been just what someone else needed to read?

bipolar,euqakhh,t1_euq4mxu,1563974403.0,"Thanks dude. Yeah I'm trying my best to get that rest (kinda my mantra). 

Some background if you want it:
I gradually transitioned from lithium to lamictal, and confirmed the Lithium was out of my system a month ago this Friday. I really don't want to go back on Lithium. 

I'm 33. My husband and I want to have kids, or at least try. I feel so much better without the lithium. I finally have energy and a personality again. I've been at least borderline hypomanic but not anywhere close to having a manic episode. 

I'm just not sleeping like I did; I was literally passing out every night for years. Now that I can actually stay up late enough to see the darkness of night it's too tempting to stay up until 10 or 11. Plus I actually have one or maybe even two friends other than my husband. 

So yes, I should probably talk to my doctor about this. I'm just afraid I'm never going to have the chance to even try to have a baby if I can't just make this work."

Lecrae,eu14u2i,t3_bamng3,1563360561.0,"I think the latest album is another showcase of Lecrae's passion and talent. His ability to speak to diverse populations is incredible. It seems like a lot of people feel like he's not being genuine with this album, or like he's trying too hard. I recommend a listen to his entire discography again if that's the consensus. I could be wrong, but I think he's being entirely true to himself, as usual. If you don't like trap, then don't listen to an album that is titled as though it's speaking directly to the trap. Unless you're willing to take the time to hear the words, dissect the wordplay, and accept the real message of the artist it's not worth your time."
Lecrae,eu13vqd,t1_ekeo64a,1563360066.0,"Saaame! But I feel like Waka put himself on it, too. I think Lecrae is largely respected in many circles. Do you really know who has friends are? I don't, but I wish I did! I mean, for me, listening to Paul Wall letting it whip with Lecrae and then Bun B speak on the same album (CC2) was mind bending. But a lot of Lecrae's songs are messages to popular artists, secular or otherwise, so what if it reached someone you wouldn't expect? Or if listening to a track just because it had one of your favorite rappers on it could change your life? I'm not trying to criticize you, your comment just made me think..."
