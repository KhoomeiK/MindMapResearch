If they didn't exist the only option would be pickup. Tipping culture is just the world we have in the US and if you want someone to bring your food to you instead of picking it up, tipping is part of that process. Yes, they can easily go find another job but it doesn't change the fact that the person is providing a service that is based solely on convince and not need. If tipping is such a huge issue like mentioned all over this thread, calling in and picking up is and always will be an option instead of delivery. And if delivery is the only option available to the person, than in the current system we have tipping has to be expected, and I'm not saying it has to be 20 percent either. Just something given it is a convince to have food brought to you."

My method is to only do orders $7 or above, has to be a dollar a mile like you are doing. Also be sure to look at the map because sometimes the payout will be decent but will take you away from the delivery area. You don't want to accept a good offer but then be faced with a drive back towards the hotspot.  The only way I will add an order to my route is if it adds 3 miles tops to my current order and has at least 5 bucks added to the base 2. Doordash is usually trying to dump a no tip order on you or save money by only paying you the 2 dollar base pay plus a small tip. I reject these add ons all day long because it is not worth the time unless it's got a good tip on it and low miles."

The simple fact is even though there are people still out there working to keep everything going, we would get out of this a lot quicker if everyone received enough help to get them through at least one month of slow or no work. I can be out there for 10 hours a day but it doesn't change the fact that most people have stocked up on food or that they simply don't want food delivered because they are scared of the virus. People need a stimulus that helps them stay home so we can put an end to all of this and get back to normal. Because if we just say ""no, we have to work and keep it going no matter what,"" people will keep getting sick, it will spread and if it got bad enough you bet your ass we will be living in a dystopian society like you think will happen from a simple government payout to it's citizens."

And I am not a liberal, I am a hard working American who usually puts in 50-60 hours of work a week, who all of a sudden can't work as much as I usually do because of something completely out of my control.
