SuicideWatch,fltfo2f,t1_fiwzdi2,1585470844.0,"I know, I was there.... I just didn't have any siblings, friends or anyone who would care if I was gone. I always imagined it would be different if there was that one person that I love and that loves me back. Now I found one and I don't think about suicide anymore because I couldn't hurt him so much. He said that he would also kill himself if I do it because he couldn't live with that pain, and I can't be responsible for killing him..."
lonely,flg6sfj,t3_folebl,1585132972.0,"It took me a long time to get over my best friend. She also from one day to the other said she doesn't want to have anything to do with me. I was so hurt and mad at her. Because she knew that she was the only friend I had and she let me anyway alone.
That started my depression to go rapidly worse! 
That was 8 years ago. Since than I couldn't find a single friend or person that would care for me until one year ago. One year ago I found my boyfriend and love of my life. He saved me from depression. He loves me even though I am a little fat, even though I hate myself. 
It may take a while but it will get better. You will find the right person."
startrek,fjd8jl0,t3_fcez6g,1583248084.0,"Today shows are all made like that, usually a season is one story. There are only a few examples. I really miss Star Trek voyager, TNG and alone stand episodes. It would be so great if they would do a new Star Trek show in this style. Tng, Voyager and DS9 were great shows and all made 7 seasons. Why can't they do another one like that if these were so successful?!"

SuicideWatch,fiubkr5,t3_f9tzom,1582738409.0,"You have to get through this part of life and all its pain. It may not seem so but it will end one day. I was depressed and suicidal for over seven years, I didn't believe that I could ever feel better but now I do. Therapy wasn't helping but after changing my therapist several times I found one that actually helped me. She worked with me on my problems but the progress was very slow. What really saved me was to find my boyfriend who loves and supports me. It took seven years but now I finally found some happiness. You have fight and struggle through the days but I'm sure one day you will be happy that you didn't succeed in killing yourself like I am now."
depression,fit93fl,t1_firqphi,1582710226.0,"I was depressed and lonely for more than seven years. A year ago I started to look for a boyfriend and he saved me. After a so long time I found a person that cared for me and was there when I was down and needed someone to hold me in my arms. 

I don't say that everyone can find a so good soul at the first time but for everyone a person like my boyfriend is out there and it's worth keeping looking for."

lonely,fir0h26,t3_f9884s,1582654910.0,"For years I was alone and depressed. I didn't have any friends in school or online, nothing at all. I didn't think that there could ever be a person that likes or loves me, because I myself hate me, so how could anyone else love such an awful and stupid person. But now after more than seven years of depression and loneliness I found a guy that loves me. I finally found a little happiness!"
