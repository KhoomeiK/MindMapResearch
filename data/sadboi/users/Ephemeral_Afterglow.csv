mentalhealth,fqd1ade,t3_ghrmqw,1589276180.0,"Im so glad I'm not the only one! all I'm seeing online is ""My mental health is so bad because of quarantine!"" ""How fight depression during quarantine"" as an introvert with social phobia I feel like the extroverts are finally understanding how bad it is to be living in a world that doesn't accommodate your needs. Sure I miss my friends and I can't wait to get out and go to brunch again but my mental health has never been better! 

My normal commute is nearly 3 hours a day on public transport to get to and from uni (I have to take a bus, train, and tram) and it's draining to be around so many strangers all day. I get home and neglect my study because I'm too exhausted to do anything. But since quarantine I've had a taste of how good life can be. 

I've always thought that there was nothing I could do about my anxiety and depression and that i was doomed to be anxious and on pills for the rest of my life, but now I see that my life can be amazing! I've finally connected with my spiritual side, I've done so much art and been enjoying my study more because I finally have time to really get stuck into my units and research more. I'm dreading going back to the real world, my uni can't be done online (science) so I'm going to have to look for a therapist because now I've had a taste of the good life. I'm worried that going back to the real world is going to cause me to have a breakdownI want my life to be how it is now, no pressure of strangers eyes, no anxiety over late trains, no getting up at 5am to travel for hours to make a 8am class. 

I should just go to therapy and fix myself but I'm starting to think maybe I'm not broken? I still will go to therapy because its necessary  for me but why can't I live and work in a way that makes me happy? why is society set up so that only extroverts get to be happy? and the rest of us have to feel inadequate and work twice as hard because our natural predisposition isn't to running around making small talk. 

Or maybe I'm just weak and not cut out for life."

melbourne,fims7tb,t1_fimemn9,1582544958.0,"Is there another option? sometimes I can't afford to go to work because my pay hasn't come through yet so I have to risk that fine I'm not trying to do the wrong thing when I have money I top up but it's not always possible. If I can't afford to legally get to work what do I do? Call in sick and lose that pay? Should I drop out of uni and do what? I'm genuinely asking a question there is no need to attack me. I get it I did the wrong thing I know that what I'm saying is I have no other options, I would have been stranded 1.5 hours from home, what should I have done? Gone to the cops and asked for a lift home?"
melbourne,fimajva,t1_fim9wxu,1582523116.0,I had -3 dollars on there lol really hope I don't get that massive fine because that'll really mess my life up atm but I guess if the government don't fine people they won't get to go on paid holidays ever other month smh
melbourne,fim9ior,t1_fim1cc4,1582522184.0,"I knew I was in the negative so I didn't touch on and I don't have any money to top it up with but I was over a hour from home so I didn't really know what I was meant to do.
Edit:
Should I have touched on? Can they book you for not having any money on the card but you still touch on?"
melbourne,filxuwc,t1_filxam4,1582512988.0,Thank you! That makes me feel a bit better.

Advice,fcvsh0x,t1_fcvsan4,1578009090.0,"Thank you! I'm just worried that there is something underlying with me because I never feel like, in therapy, we ever get to the point of why I'm feeling the way that I am. But maybe Im just being stupid about it ya know"

transgenderau,fbhxn99,t3_ed50aw,1576885060.0,I've been messaging all my friends who bind asking if they're all okay and making sure they're all drinking water and taking breaks. Us binder folk have to band together and watch out for one another in this transphobicly hot weather!
Advice,fbhv0tf,t1_fbhusz9,1576883047.0,"I've got enough money to last me till February so that's rent and bills and a little in savings for unexpected things but after that I'm on my own.
I've applied to a few places but no one has gotten back to me as of yet so it's just a bit nerve racking but I'm willing to put in the hard work and search for jobs it's just scary not having income."
Advice,fb7cwof,t1_fb7ct60,1576585645.0,Thank you I'll give that a go!
transgenderau,f8tqrfu,t1_f8tql49,1574809236.0,I have about a grand in super but maybe if I can get hold of it that's some money! Thanks for the idea!
transgenderau,f0i8e4f,t1_f0i69w0,1568637752.0,I asked that and they said that that isn't possible and I need to have a consultation first because I'm a new patient. I do have some androfort left from earlier in my transition is it worth using that so my levels don't drop?
