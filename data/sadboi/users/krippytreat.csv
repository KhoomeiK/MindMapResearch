CasualConversation,fq0nb9p,t1_fpyd984,1589034654.0,"I struggled for a long time with being VERY shy and having a lot of social anxiety. Giving compliments to people I know and even people I don’t know, really helped me to step out of that uncomfortable shyness and grow from my social anxiety. Plus it feels so nice to see you made someone smile. Who doesn’t love that??"
CasualConversation,fq0mxuj,t1_fq0a0at,1589034506.0,"This is very well said! 

A friend once told me something along the lines of “there is a fine line between being nice and coming off as flirty/hitting on someone.” And I think that is pretty true! I don’t know when complimenting someone went from a nice gesture to crossing a boundary so to speak. 

And I agree, the world would be a much kinder place if this was practiced more “innocently” for lack of a better word. 

Thank you for your insight! I hope you have a really great day."
