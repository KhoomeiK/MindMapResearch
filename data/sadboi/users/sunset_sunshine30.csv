I was told - just study (I'm asian). I got a boyfriend at 16 and I just had no idea how to behave with the opposite sex. 

I got into an emotionally abusive relationship with an avoidant abuser and I was with him on and off until 25. 

Since then I have dated on and off but again seem to pick avoidant men. I think I myself am a bit avoidant too because of the shame I was made to feel about dating and the fact I never learned how to deal with my both anxious and avoidant tendencies. 

It's also annoying because my parents now ask me why I dont have a boyfriend  (35F) 🙄."

We went on the date and had a nice time. A few of his stories seemed a but outlandish but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He told me he wanted to meet me again in the week, a proper date. Great, I said. 
Went home and lo and behold he sends me a fully nude picture. I was like ok that's it, I'm done. I told him that it was hugely disrespectful. He said that he was upset that I didnt like his picture and I never heard from him again.
