InfiniteJest,fehcsac,t3_emrd84,1579113896.0,Love it as a summary for themes or connections maybe missed after reading a chapter. There is no substitution for the book itself however.

An original poem

One morning, Mother Nature cast out all her hurt and anger over a small village 
It matters not where
She had been trampled on, taken for granted, and largely ignored
A boy who had once run through her magnificent fields
Now tossed cigarette butts carelessly into the familiar dirt
A girl who once swam in her rivers
Has now long forgotten the simplistic beauty of the cool water‚Äôs caress.
Mother Earth has been tossed aside, never mentioned in conversation.
Not really.
Though we all know her well.
Some of us hurt
Some have been made to be ghosts
A tramp or a wino
When we were born, God said he was blessing us 
With the gifts of few stars
In many universes
Maybe
But the loneliness
That unbearable, pervasive sadness
Is like being a forgotten tree
Or a mountain of trash
The origin was beauty
But what has it become?
What have these souls become?
A question to themselves only, maybe
I met a girl by chance 
I don‚Äôt have very good luck
The say the universe gives you gifts
Maybe I wasn‚Äôt home
Anyway, I met a girl who was like this Mother
Beautiful and pure 
And damaged
The best people are so they say
Maybe God was right after all
I came across her one afternoon weeping in the meadow
I took her by the hand and poured her a cup of tea
Her dress had holes so I sewed them
Here eyes had tears so I dried them
I went to the store and bought one seed
We planted a tree together one overcast day
It grew slow, but it grew strong
My God soon neither one of us could believe what we had made
We stood there, proud of him, and he stood there proud of us.
Off in the distance I heard rolling thunder
We made love underneath the tree"

depression,epvyon1,t3_bw23tp,1559558668.0,"My therapist refers to this as pervasive sadness. Just this underlying sadness that's always there. Things have been better since I've been on Lexapro, but for me it was always me laughing or having fun and then my heart dropped into the pit of my stomach. Depression is always there to remind you, ""This good feeling won't last. Don't have too much fun""."
depression,epvexsz,t1_epsvrk9,1559532009.0,"Pervasive sadness is what my therapist calls it. For me it was pretty much like you described. I'd be laughing or having fun, and then I'd have this sudden feeling of dread and my heart would drop into my stomach."
depression,epao9ja,t3_budf8b,1559131003.0,"This is a completely normal feeling. I suffered from this for a very long time before I got on Lexapro. A lot of this can be traced back to a significant event either from childhood or maybe a relationship of some kind. 

I grew up with a functioning depressed Father, meaning that his moods were inconsistent. The highs could become lows at sny moment. Through therapy I was able to realize that that's where my feeling of dread came from. It usually came on when I was having a good time. All of s sudden my heart would drop into my stomach. What is yours like?"
depression,epanok5,t3_budenv,1559130752.0,"I recently started a new relationship. I'm 29 and spent most of my life never having a serious relrelationship due to depression and anxiety. I literally didn't feel standard emotions like love or attraction for a long time, and any semi-romantic interaction I'd have, in the back of my mind I knew it wasn't going to go anywhere. I think lexapro and therapy has done wonders for me. I want to spend time with my girlfriend and actually do things. I don't crave alone time as much, and it makes for a healthier relationship. So it's possible, but seeking help is the first step for sure."
depression,ep8pdmm,t1_ep8ijbu,1559098034.0,"Yeah I hear that. I always see it as my parents talking on a different wavelength. My Dad plays devil's advocate about everything so venting only makes me feel worse. My Mom repeats things she wants me to do, and will literally not respond and look at her phone while I'm talking sometimes. No one is perfect but refusing to change is just not right."
depression,ep59dlx,t1_ep58rdu,1559052457.0,"Yeah I'm working on it. I'm on Lexapro as well, and I think I'm feeling more angry at them than depressed these days."
