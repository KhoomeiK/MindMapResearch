leaves,etjtioi,t1_etjgvx6,1562881143.0,"Personally, I used marijuana to cope with a lot of untreated personal issues. It sort of numbed me, if that makes sense. I became so complacent with sitting on my couch everyday, and also complacent in my depression. I guess for the first time in a while, I’m just feeling alive, and appreciating the small things (like the wind, the sun, the sound of the rain) in a way that I haven’t in a very long time. 

We are all different though, and my experience may be unlike yours, and that’s ok :)"
leaves,etinjdw,t1_etin88n,1562855420.0,"I couldn’t agree more. It was definitely hard at first (daily smoker for 14 years) but each day it gets easier. And I’ve felt emotions I haven’t felt in years. The sun and the wind feel different on my skin. It’s been very enlightening. Anyone can do it, even if we have setbacks, we all have the strength inside to keep going."

relationship_advice,etgk8m6,t1_etgjx2w,1562792815.0,"The only thing I can agree on is that she should leave. However, sometimes it’s not always that easy. Things aren’t always so cut and dry.

Telling someone if they don’t have sex with you (even when they don’t want to) or “there will be problems” is a threat. It’s not okay, no matter what. Thats when I lost any empathy I had for him. Sorry, not sorry."
relationship_advice,etgjo6v,t1_etghfm3,1562792454.0,"“hell no, that’s not how this works. I’ve already told you, if you don’t show me affection and give me sex then we’re gonna have problems in our marriage. Because that’s what I need”  - that was her husband's response when she told him she didn't have to have sex against her will anymore. That is abusive and misogynistic behavior. Using intimidation to coerce someone into sex is fucked up. Did you even read the post? Seems like you are pretty triggered by a woman not being attracted enough to a man to have sex with him. Weird.

and thanks, it was a cool story."
relationship_advice,etggvzx,t1_etg7n17,1562790713.0,"Your rhetoric is full of misogyny and judgement. She isn’t holding sex hostage. She clearly doesn’t want to have sex with someone she is no longer attracted to. He believes he is owed sex based on being married, that’s fucked up and if he acts on that it’s marital rape. 

You assume he’s providing “support”, that’s also fucked up and riddled with misogyny. Sounds like some involuntary celibate shit. 

You’re gross and so is her shitty husband."
relationship_advice,etg756g,t1_etg5pu1,1562785089.0,I don’t think you understand the definition of rape. Being married is not a blanket consent for sex for the rest of her life.
