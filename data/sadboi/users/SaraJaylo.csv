Idk about y’all but sometimes emotions just rush through me all at once. Sadness, anger, frustration bubble up but you’ve felt those things so strongly for so long that it’s almost background noise to this nothingness.

When you know I try to explain all the “good” reasons why antinatalism is the reality of life right now she basically just went “la la la la! I’m gonna live MY life in MY world and i choose to be happy.” 

In my head going “ah so your just gonna bury your head in the sand and ignore the horrible reality of life on this rock.”  Ok mom..sure you had the same mentality when you made the biggest mistake of your life in having me.

Bottom line: pick and choose your battles. My choices are either hide my opinion in fake smiles or be alone.

You need to find someone you trust the most. Preferably outside of your workplace because let’s face it, there is a stigma on mental illness and an even bigger one with BPD.
