Second, it‚Äôs not his business how much are you taking, just tell him you don‚Äôt have anymore. You‚Äôve been a good friend and gave him your doctor‚Äôs number, if he wants drugs, he needs a prescription and he needs to call the doctor.

AmItheAsshole,fqg6qjf,t1_fqg3k6c,1589339164.0,"In a loving relationship you are definitely a team, you can‚Äôt make it work otherwise. The fact that he takes every chance he gets to vocally celebrate a body that is the opposite of yours shows he has no respect for you. He‚Äôs using words like insecurity/weak to shift the blame on you when it‚Äôs not the case. 

Personally I believe the partner can respectfully ask questions if they have the need (about your choice for breast implants in this case), and you can answer but you don‚Äôt have to bring arguments and defend yourself. They get answers if you want to give them, they accept them or they end the relationship. They don‚Äôt use it as ammunition for roasts or fights.

You are beautiful and our bodies should be celebrated in whatever shape and size because they do so much for us every single day."

Pettiness aside, try to emphasize how he makes you feel and maybe bridge that feeling to a situation that would make him feel that way. He needs to correct this man-splaining behaviour because it will create a lot of trouble in your relationship in the long run."
