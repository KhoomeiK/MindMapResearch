They also do not have any public access rights, so the term I think you are looking for is actually therapy dog, which do need some training and testing to certify them. Therapy dogs get to go to hospitals and schools to help comfort lots of people! ESAs are basically prescribed pets that stay at home and comfort their owner, and aren’t required to have any training at all (they’re only allowed in pet-friendly places). And then there are service dogs who are task trained to assist a person with a disability, and they’re the ones that have all public access rights. The terms, access rights, and training of each kind of dog can get kind of confusing sometimes! I hope she gets to become a therapy dog once this pandemic is over!!!"

I definitely recommend a biothane leash though, and I’ve seen people using vinyl vests so they can sanitize them afterward!!!!"

service_dogs,fjj5uiv,t3_fdkiaw,1583384192.0,"Definitely don’t try to rush things. You can burn out your pup by training for such long hours when it’s so young. this could possibly result in her being defiant and not wanting to listen to your commands because she’ll equate training to being tired and forced to obey. Training all day on the weekends is extremely tiring for a puppy, 4 months is when they’re doing a lot of growing and losing/growing teeth and such so their body is already working hard. I know a lot of people just focus on perfecting basic obedience in the first 6 months before heavily training tasking (so introducing tasks but not requiring them to be done in public yet without prompting for example). Since most dogs require around 2 years to be fully trained, that leaves 1.5 years for you to perfect the tasking and service dog aspect, so you really don’t need to rush it!"

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, GAD, and BPD a year ago but I was living most of my life so far with a diagnoses of depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. a lot of the symptoms cross over into each other so it’s often a combination anyways.

I personally believe that a psd should really be a last resort sort of thing. If you’ve only tried like 2 meds and 2 different doctors for example, trying one more medication that may positively change your life forever is so much easier than going through the process and maintenance of a service animal that can easily be so frustrating."

Regarding the new diagnosis and questioning it, I really recommend the New Harbinger bipolar II workbook.

Leave too big of a gap, you’ll have an ugly band of orange or yellow. the thing with people going to school for hair is that they also learn about the specific products and PRACTICE the perfect application. It’s possible to do it at home if you are super careful though, and have someone else apply because there’s no way to be accurate when applying it to your own head (this coming from someone who bleaches their own hair.

piercing,ffwynto,t3_evo647,1580313967.0,Body art forms has high quality jewellery!
piercing,ffwylkd,t3_evokl9,1580313928.0,"you really shouldn’t be have downsized tbh, it was just an irritation bump, not a keloid. Keloids are super rare and are mostly prevalent in people with dark skin and it’s genetic!"
piercing,ffwygq5,t3_evolac,1580313842.0,"Honestly looks like an irritation bump, have you knocked it or been sleeping on it? Maybe use a travel pillow to sleep and put you ear inside the hole, if that makes sense. It prevents your ear from being directly against your pillow"
piercing,ffwybyy,t1_ffwr5w9,1580313758.0,I guess you can do 3 but my cartilage piercings usually take a year to properly heal so I would rather deal with less!
piercing,ffwy7ir,t1_ffwigmo,1580313681.0,"A healed piercing shouldn’t get that agitated though, it’s so swollen! You’ll have to baby it again like a new piercing for a while"
piercing,ffw0016,t3_evh3f5,1580278798.0,body art forms is my fav for high quality! arctic buffalo has cute ones too
piercing,ffvzs5b,t3_evi7my,1580278575.0,"If you get them on both ears, you’re gonna have a lot of trouble sleeping! I would personally only do two piercings at a time on the same ear and wait for them to heal before getting the rest on the other ear"
piercing,ffvznz4,t3_evigrm,1580278455.0,Is it fresh? It’s looks very very upset!!!
service_dogs,ffvzk96,t1_ffvycqr,1580278346.0,"I mean it really is up to you, your gf and parents are probably only concerned about it because they think it’s too complicated. But if it’s going to impact you so severely, the benefit of bringing your pup really outweighs the stress and complicated-ness of bringing him with you. Obviously a dog is still a living being and not just medical equipment so you have to be very very accommodating to make it work for the both of you! it’ll probably take way more extra planning and extra effort to keep your SD in a good headspace to be about to work for you and be your lifeline, but it should be worth it in the end."
service_dogs,ffvyp0y,t3_evgcrl,1580277463.0,"I’m also canadian and I’m considering a waterproof mat too! I was just really concerned about putting the mat on the muddy bus floor and then having to put it back in my bag? I guess you’d have to carry like a plastic bag to shove the dirty mat into? and I just don’t know how I’m supposed to put the mat down on a crowded bus/subway lol. It doesn’t help that my dog is long haired and entirely white 😅 the next concern with a snowsuit/pants or whatever is that my dog is long haired so I’d probably have to take it off her once I got to my lecture or else she’d be really hot the whole time. so this means undressing and redressing her and then redressing her to leave.... so complicated, I wish public transit floors didn’t get so slushy 😪"
service_dogs,ffvy67m,t1_ffvxdru,1580276943.0,"“at least I’ll be vibin” LMAOO 😂 but anyways, I considered bringing my service dog on a vacation I’ll have in a few months, and I’ve decided not to. She’s also a psychiatric SD. I decided against it personally because I just think she’ll be more comfortable staying at home with my parents. I don’t want to stress her with the travel (3-4 hour plane ride) because I recognize that she is still a dog and it’s not natural for her to have to deal with what comes with a plane flight. (Or I guess in your case, an uncomfortable long drive. BUT I think even a short plane ride is worse for a dog than a long drive anyways) I also considered how much she’d “slow us down” while I explore a new place with my boyfriend and his family. I’ll be with people that can help me in similar ways that my SD helps me with, so that was a big deciding factor in being able to leave her at home to just take a break from working and have her own vacation! I think if you feel like you don’t completely NEED your SD, you could possibly consider not taking them. but if your first thought is “no, I can’t function even slightly well without them”, then you should probably take your pup for your own safety and just make sure you accommodate for them as best you can (like breaks from driving to take a half hour walk, training them for longer drives, finding ways to distract them, best ways to make them comfortable in the Airbnb etc.)"

bipolar,ffssxld,t1_ffsskwx,1580191291.0,"I think my girl is fluffier now, this was taken when she was 1, she’s now 1.5 years old haha. but I do follow a lot of Japanese spitz’s on insta and they do look fluffier I think"
bipolar,ffss1pu,t1_ffsrmhs,1580190391.0,yeah they’re closely related for sure! I can barely tell the difference between the two breeds 😂
service_dogs,ffshr55,t1_ffshizo,1580182000.0,I literally ordered a bunch of stuff to make my own SD gear a few days ago and i was like hmmm..... maybe I’m hypomanic rn lol
piercing,ffsgxim,t1_ffsg5o6,1580181435.0,"I wouldn’t risk it, just keep it constantly flipped up. I keep mine flipped up probably 80-90% of the time and take it down whenever I wanna wear it out"
