Can you access the water meter? You should be able to. Do you share the meter with another apartment in the building?

If you can access the meter (legally you should), use it to monitor your use and check for leaks. Write down your complete meter reading (black and red numbers) before you go to bed and dont use any water during the night (no flushing etc). In the morning, check the meter straight away. The reading should be the exact same. 

If it is the same: you are using a lot. Try timing showers or doing other things to limit use.

If the reading is not the same: you have a leak somewhere. It could be hidden (for example in a cellar) so call your landlord to discuss this.
