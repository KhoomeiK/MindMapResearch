BDSMAdvice,fqea2oz,t3_gi6ulv,1589304193.0,"As someone who has been in abusive relationships and dealt with revenge porn, please, please, please press charges, get a protective order, get out and stay out. You may feel shame, embarrassment, or just feel like you don’t have the emotional energy to press charges but please do! He did this to his ex, he did this to you, he’s most likely done it to others and will continue to do so. He needs to be stoped. 

Also, please reach out to a counselor/therapist for support. See if there is a support group in your area for survivors of domestic violence. If there is a domestic violence shelter in your area they can help you with all of the above. 

Personally, I would also reach out to his ex. You can support each other in court. You might even find a friendship with her. Abusive relationships can actually be a pretty big thing to bond over. 

Good luck and feel free to message me if you ever want/need to talk."

Unfortunately, he has ED, which of course isn’t his fault, but it’s one of the issues. He also has a much lower libido than I do. While I can understand and work around those two issues, the biggest issue of all is, he’s vanilla. As in extremely vanilla and I am, well, definitely not vanilla at all. I have suggested things in an effort to find middle ground to no avail. He likes things one way and one way only. I’m not satisfied with that and no amount of talking about it with him has helped. 

He broke up with me because of the incompatibility, though the split amicable. We’re both frustrated by the incompatibility and unsure how to/if we should proceed. Frankly I think it’s a fruitless endeavor to attempt to fix it but I’m also not fond of walking away from someone I’m otherwise compatible with."
