Enjoy the cookie."

AskReddit,erh2d2l,t3_c1wj6i,1560865331.0,"This is going to sound somber but, I actually remember my first ever memory, the oldest memory in my memory bank if you will. the day I burst out of the ether of infancy and into reality. It was me and my best friend. We were playing basket ball on a short kiddy sized alleyway hoop. I took the perfect shot that was sure to go in. Kyle, standing under the hoop bogarting it, launches his basketball grandma style between his legs two handed straight into the air, STRIKING my ball and knocking it off its course and sending it clear across the alley! I was so mad at Kyle that day. He killed himself last year.  Not even old enough to legally drink but old enough to own a shotgun says the government. You die twice in this world, when your heart stops beating, and when the last person thinks about you for the very last time. Your legacy lives on inside of my memory Kyle I think about you every day. 

I have no memories prior to this one. We came into this experiment together, were going out together. I love you buddy."
