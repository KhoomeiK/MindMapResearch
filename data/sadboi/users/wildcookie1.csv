Having been thinking of some ideas to get around this.
1. Volunteer to take an elderly person in your community to the shops during this time. 
2. Taking their shopping list to get it done for them. 

On top of this nothing has been released to protect people on zero hour contracts. If it gets to the point that we‚Äôre all in lockdown: Another idea of mine was to set up a crowd funding page to be able to get food to those most vulnerable and will struggle with no work.

No idea how you‚Äôd assess this. I guess you could work with a charity."
