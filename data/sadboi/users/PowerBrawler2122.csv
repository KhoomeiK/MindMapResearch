Gundam,fnktdb2,t1_fnksu22,1587039390.0,"True, good points, again I agree. I honestly think if the Unicorn could be fast enough during those five minutes, it could simply shoot the Qan[t] down. It's shots aren't coated with GN particles, and they aren't physical bullets. The Turn A, well, the Unicorn could maybe avoid the beam teleporting, but it has to be faster, and I highly doubt (although the Unicorn is my 100% favorite and I love it) that it could be fast enough.

Gundam,fnksblt,t1_fnks3m9,1587038514.0,"You do have good points, and I agree with you. Teleportation is nice, but so are I-Fields. Honestly, I think if it had to, the Unicorn could kinda protect itself in a bubble, sort of like the Nu Gundam can with it's Fin Funnels. The Turn A might just trigger another event like what happened with the Phenex in Narritive, or even like what happened with the Neo Zeong 1 in Unicorn.
