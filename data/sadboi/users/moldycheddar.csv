I know you’re in college and so am I. We are currently surrounded with opportunities, but... Just wanted to put it out there.”

In response, I got a - “I feel the same way, but I’m not a perfect person and there’s a lot about me that no one knows.” Based on our previous interactions, I could immediately tell. “Do you feel like a sociopath sometimes?”, which is how I used to feel before I realized that it could not accurately describe me. “Idk.” I basically then went into, “do you feel emotions very strongly?” And received a no in response, we had a very “INTJ-ey” conversation, basically a Q and A, and she wondered how I was reading her mind. Turns out we’re very similar, and I CAN read her relatively well, I believe. She is interested, but being rationalists we both agreed that we are in college and that if things progress, it was meant to be. If not, it wasn’t. Simple as that. She’s the only person I’ve found that similar to myself, although a bit more emotionally underdeveloped. Engineering major, deep interest in physics (my major), reserved.

What troubles me - I do not wish to come out with my PhD. and not find any jobs in academia (exactly what I spent six years of my life earning that degree to achieve). I do not want a PhD, find zero academic careers, and wind up becoming an engineer, analyst, risk management, etc. I would be extremely overqualified and doing things for the sake of helping businesses succeed. If I wanted to become one of those, I would’ve majored in that instead and I would’ve been saving a ton of student expenses as well.

That’s a pretty efficient way of putting it - it’s that aspect of it that frightens me. It’s a gamble. If you want to get better at basketball, go practice. With physics, it’s not like you can inject creativity into your bloodstream or go on some bunk website that claims neuroplasticity will somehow turn you into a well of knowledge. If you get into grad school and don’t possess the mental capacity to prove yourself... Well... Here’s your bachelors in physics - go back and try again or become like a....... like an analyst or something and suck it up.

I’m sure you know what I’m trying to say here. I am willing to do the work. I feel like I am capable enough.

I wish there were a more stable career selection available to physics students. To my knowledge, many find research to be daunting partly because of this - 10+ years in school, several years making barely more than you would doing manual labor, and an uncertain future. Your best bet is becoming an actuary - but who gets a PhD. to become an actuary, lol. Other than that, you really need to somehow find a teaching/research role at a university/government/private research facility. To do that, you need to already be an extraordinary candidate and done some notable things, during your education.

If I were to pursue psychology, I could do research as well. Maybe become the next Jordan Peterson, I don’t know...
