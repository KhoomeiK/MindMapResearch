Never downplay your sobriety. Every day is a huge accomplishment. 

Just got 13 months sober myself. I know how tough it is. Keep it going! Proud of you!!"
BPD,f7y86gi,t3_dxx4ki,1574089057.0,I wish it wasnt like this. I wish I knew how to get over this one. I've  Been married over a year and I still get scared my partner is rejecting me. Cant stand when they leave. And hate being by myself
BPD,f5vv6p9,t3_dpcdpp,1572501618.0,"Honestly just found this reddit 2 days ago and it has made me feel  much less lonely. There are men with bpd,. Yes it is similar in men and women, We just have these stupid gender roles and stereotypes to battle. It's hard enough for men to show emotion. Let alone have emotion control our lives. Every guy i know fits the macho  stereotype which makes me that much more of an outcast. Yes we do exist, and I'm thankful I found somewhere that I dont feel so alone."
BPD,f5sszni,t1_f5sh35d,1572442365.0,Yea I definitely think the fluidity is something that can ease me a little bit. I think it is just being hyper aware that makes me question almost everything in life. Thank you again for the reply and insight. It helps knowing I'm not the only one who feels like this.
