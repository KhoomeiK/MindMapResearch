High quality recordings in a studio could be as high as 96,000 per second.  Is your metronome count in accurate to sync it to 1 out of 44,100 every second?

Second problem, Unfortunately those two cell phones are running off of batteries.  They aren't communicating to each other, and so even if you could send a signal that would start recording on both phones at the same time, after 3 or 4 minutes, you may be out of sync between the two phones by several samples without ever knowing it.  

When I connect two recording devices together to be able to record 16 tracks at the same time, I have to use word clock, adat, smte, or another protocol to make sure that the two systems stay in sync with each other.

Not that you aren't getting ok results from it, but I would get myself a stereo field recorder, the microphones would be better, auto stereo field, about a thousand other reasons why it would be better. They are only a hundred or so dollars.
