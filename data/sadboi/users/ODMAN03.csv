I don’t really want to go in full detail, I’m still after 2 years since watching it trying to understand it and how it has affected me and if I’m lying to myself or whatever, but at the end of the film which I won’t spoil I just found myself relating to Taki Tachibana like nothing I’ve ever done I think. I’m still trying to figure out myself, but I often feel as though I’m completely emotionless. Like I’m detached from this world in a way. I don’t know if that’s how it is, but I feel like that’s the best way I can describe how I feel often. Like all I can feel is the weight of my own breath. And something about the last scene of the film was beautiful to me. 

Maybe I’ll find out in a year that I’ve been lying to myself all along like my anxieties constantly tells me. But all I know is that something about the anime left me a different person"

 Maybe make the film feel more dream-like. I keep using the argument that the movie explores dreams so the common plotholes people often state makes sense, but it would work better if the story just felt a *little* more like a dream. Maybe just how some scenes would be directed

Other than that, nitpicks about how I think the blushing looks off color-wise, an exposition scene I really like but would not be sad about losing the lines written for the audience.

But I mean as a whole I don’t think those flaws affect my experience while watching and after watching the film really. The core of the film is so interesting and the ending is the only piece of fiction I can truly relate to in a way that it doesn’t matter I just love it"

anime,fqspmea,t3_gk7tq8,1589614451.0,"I’d mainly recommend you two things. Regarding the lineart I think there could be more decision in it. If that sounds weird then I’d check out Ethan Becker’s video on [drawing with triangles](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FCHhNJWzUnc) which has helped me out a ton. To simplify it, using triangles can make sure exactly what form and direction a part of the body has, which can be extremely useful. I’d say the best thing you can do as an artist to improve is to understand what you draw.

Secondly I’ll just say that the white skin color puts me off and a warmer color could work better and the shading looks like a darker version of the base color which can look plain. I’d suggest changing the hue of the color to make it pop off more. Think about where the light source comes and look at your drawing as a 3D form.

I saw someone else note that the long neck is weird because of proportions. I’d say having a long neck in your art is fine if it suits your genre. Although I mainly base that of the “scary art has long necks” meme.

He sees it as a game or something, not seeing the effects of what he’s doing.
