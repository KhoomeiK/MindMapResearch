HuntShowdown,ercgrh1,t1_ercdtgr,1560711723.0,"I'm all for raising the strategery and skill cap in competitive type games, but these artificial constraints are more of an annoyance than an enjoyable challenge. Stalking hunters, flanking to advantageous positions, carefully planning routes, that's fun. Ensuring you maximize the value of your limited ammunition, that's fun. 20 second shootouts that devolve into scrambling around a compound looking for a giant red box that contains 3 rounds and a shell just cause your pockets are tiny, that is not fun (imo). It's come to the point where most games I bring a winnie, just cause I don't want the hassle of dealing with this tedious mini-game.

I'm all for balance. Most weapons fill a niche that can be fun to exploit. I just don't think handicapping high-tier weapons thru severely limiting ammo is an enjoyable and fair compromise. They are already gated by cost and level requirements. Hell, the threat of losing your investment alone makes them a high-risk high-reward situation. In the end, the enjoyment payout I get from them usually ends up being minimal just cause hunters have tiny pocket syndrome."
