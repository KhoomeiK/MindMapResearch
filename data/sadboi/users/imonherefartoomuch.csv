The plant is not root bound??!!. Have you seen the size of it? It's tiny, there is no way this would have a root system great enough to fill the pot. No way on Earth.

The plants roots have rotted??!! Are you all fucking high? Can you not see the soil is bone dry? What gives you the impression that it's soaking wet? 

Anyway, to the op. 
The plant looks fucked mate, it's not worth wasting electricity on. It has been allowed to get too dry in a soil that's probably too hot for it. 
It also could have done with a humidity dome whilst its roots were developing.
