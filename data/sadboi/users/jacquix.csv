My guy, I brought up Thatcher not out of thin air, but because the lead singer stated his support of her. I said it because he said it. I, however, didn't say anything about the Falklands war. And I certainly said nothing to warrant you writing entire novels. Though, of course, be my guest if you feel that's necessary. Just don't expect me to respond with the same level of ... enthusiasm, I guess?

Ok, I just went and learned some history.  
Thatcher's PM gig: '79-'90  
Miners' strike: '84-'85  


I guess you learned a different history than the rest of us. Now of course there were strikes before her, and there were strikes after her as well, but we're talking about the time frame relevant to New Wave, yes?

> I guarantee you that Gary Kemp was not thinking about Thatcher or the Falklands war when they wrote ""True. 

You think? Granted, you're probably right. Though I don't know why we're talking about the Falklands to begin with. It's not like Thatcher did only one thing during her time of being PM. There's that ""Union Busting"", and the large scale strikes that were a response to her politics. It doesn't always have to be as obvious as with the Sex Pistols for example, but your weird tangent about ""artists objectivity"" has little to do contemporary music, which is by definition a part of a specific time frame's culture. It's called ""contemporary"" for a reason.  
Of course we can choose to create art that is intentionally detached and isolated from our current socio-cultural environment, but that's neither New Romantic nor New Wave.

This whole Falklands thing is a complex issue, bro. And I'm not invested enough to start a lengthy discussion about it. Just two thoughts. 1) Thatcher didn't respond with military force to defend communists, but to ensure Englands territorial claim stemming from past colonialist aggression. 2) I'm not a pacifist, I said war should be avoided if possible. Or maybe ""if reasonable"" would be a better choice of words. For example, I'm totally in support of Orwell's journey to Spain, to help kick Franco's fascist ass. That the Soviet backed communists turned out to be counterrevolutionaries is a whole different can of worms.

But to elaborate, of course cultural environment influences an artist's output, especially when their music is in tandem with a fashion fad and other social dynamics. Or would you seriously consider New Romantic, or even New Wave in general, a music movement that could be placed just about anywhere in modern history? It's an obvious product of its time frame.  


> But when you inject your politics into EVERYTHING

Easy there. If I remember correctly, we only talked once before, about Gary Numan. Where I happened to also make a remark about his past support for Thatcher, which is a well-known fact. Other than that, I sometimes talk about politics, sometimes I don't. I don't inject it into EVERYTHING. But even if I did, I could still enjoy the music, even if I disagreed with the artist's views. It's not mutually exclusive.  


> You keep bringing it up and you didn't answer my question regarding the Falklands. 

Like I said, mentioned it once before. And I didn't realize this is some type of official interrogation. But I'm happy to talk about the Falklands, except I don't have a terribly strong opinion about it except for the fact that it seemed to be a rather unnecessary action and a result of reactionary, post-imperialist policies.

Absinthe,fenn7tp,t3_epqe1x,1579288092.0,"As with all absinthes, you want to make sure they're an authentic product with historic accuracy. This puts red absinthes in a bit of a conundrum - we do know of one historical rouge (as evidenced by [this poster](http://www.feeverte.de/images/Absinthe_Rosinette.jpg)), but unless I'm thoroughly mistaken, there's no reliable historical source for an authentic recipe. So with red absinthe, it's technically impossible to consider any product historically authentic, as we simply don't know what they put in there to give it its color.

When it comes to quality however, the same rules apply as with white or greens: no artificial colorants, inclusion of the ""holy trinity"" (green anise, fennel seeds, grand wormwood), distillation. I haven't tried it, but as others mentioned, the red Awen Nature is well reputed and fits all criteria for a good quality absinthe."

I still struggle with myself to fully admit how terrible my mental and emotional state has been in the past. And I do believe there are cultural issues that contribute to said difficulties that can be attributed to gender norms and expectations. At the same time, having met many people suffering from depression and other mood disorders, it isn't easy for anyone really. Self-condemnation doesn't really stop at any particular gender, race, age or religion. We're all experiencing the same monster, only from different perspectives.

If part of the problem is found in societal norms, we need to make a positive change to society as a whole. And we won't achieve that if we disregard the struggle of people who are different by some arbitrary denominator. Let's choose solidarity, I say."

Sure, that's fair. At the same time, let's remember that the earliest interest in a ""distilled"" view didn't actually come from within the subculture itself, but was a impulse from music publishing companies, as with many different other music genres. Creating a neatly packaged, clear-cut definition to use it as a product that can easily be marketed and sold to a homogeneous target audience.

I guess there is not ""one"" definite guitar tone in goth rock, very fair. I think what I had in mind was more of that sharp tone of earlier, lesser refined amps that didn't have that thick, saturated distortion sound that became standard sometime in the mid-80s. More along the lines of those guitar shrieks of Bauhaus' Bela Lugosi. Or Joy Division's Day of the Lords, to a slightly lesser extent."

It was a coup paving the way for an illegitimate fascist government. Everyone in the left ""youtube-sphere"" got this right from the beginning.

But one of the most awesome aspect of subcultures are their history and origins. Be it punk, goth or metal, or even hip hop for that matter, they all started as something revolutionary without a blueprint. Some people somewhere decided to start a movement that breaks the norms. And as much as I love goth, I feel this strict adherence to labels and rigidity is pure stagnation, suffocating. It's just my personal opinion, but I say, don't worry about labels, where you fit in, or if others would consider you a poseur. Express your individuality without compromise. Especially if that means doing something that nobody has ever done before."

Nowadays, being an old ass who refuses to go with the times, I wouldn't call myself a ""full blown goth"", for whatever that's supposed to mean. But I'd definitely say I still have some of that old goth spirit left in me. And if anyone would feel the need to tell me otherwise, I certainly wouldn't grant them the authority to define who or what I am.

Button-ups, black jeans, boots, a well-fitted coat, boom, good to go. Looks killer for all genders and can be modified to full goth with just a bit of jewelry and make up. And maybe a band shirt or whatever other cliched accessory you'd like to include.  
And not least, it's all about how you feel in your own skin, so don't stress out too much what other people might think about you.
