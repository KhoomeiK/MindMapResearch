I feel like people tend to assume all depressed people are suicidal.

KindVoice,fcii3ta,t3_ehbu4w,1577662913.0,"I get it. I’m 17f, also shy and introverted, and I have social anxiety which can make it hard to talk to people. Just know you’ll find your people, and it seems you’ve got nice friends so I’m happy you have that. 
I have a “Sad Boi Hours” playlist which is full of sad, empowering, or calming songs. Usually I just cry for a while listening to it and honestly it helps. I feel like it’s a way to let all my negative feelings out. Also journaling your thoughts (or venting like here which I’ve also done) tends to help. 
Trust me talking about how you feel helps. I told my best friend about a month ago and it really helped. Also you said you have an okay relationship with your friends, so that’s a start. I won’t say to “just go be social” because I know it’s not that easy. What I will say is it helps to find a way to express your emotions (like journaling, a hobby, crying, poetry maybe). Then, try to talk to your friends more. I get it’s hard, but it helps to at least try to make an effort. Maybe invite them to go out somewhere, or send memes if that helps you. 

This was long so I apologize, but basically I want you to know you’re not alone. Also my pm’s are always open if you ever want to talk about anything at all.

I hope you have a nice day <3 ~virtual hug~ <3"

depression,fchwlam,t1_fchq7j7,1577654991.0,"Yeah I get that. My group is kinda big (like 10-12 countering me), but I wouldn’t tell every person since I have like 6 or so that I’m really close to. I’m also wondering if it’s the kind of thing I should say to them all at once or maybe separately. 
The 6 I’m close to are in different groups. Like I have 3 in one small group (newer friends, but I feel they’d get it more), and 3 in another (friends for a while but I only know one that would definitely understand since she’s dealt with mental health issues in the past). 

And I think it’s great you can just bring it up, but I don’t know if I can do that. I’m in high school so most of the time I see them is at school and I just don’t think I can do it there. The first time I actually told someone was with the letter and I cried, and I just don’t wanna do that at school. 

Also sometimes one of my friends notices that I get sad sometimes and always asks what’s wrong (like if I’m mad or sad or something) and I always just say “I’m fine”, “I’m tired”, or I’m “stressed about my _____ test.” 
I’m wondering if at those times I could just say it (maybe not go into detail right away, and just say we can talk about it later).
I remember one time I kind of jokingly was like “someone’s in a mood” to which she responded: “Because my dad was being an asshole and yelling at me in the car this morning.” I was silent and she was like “I love being morbid.” 
{The point I’m trying to make is she was honest so casually about what was going on with her and I’m thinking that maybe I can do that too}
