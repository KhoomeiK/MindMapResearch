Check-in times can often interfere with work hours, as do potentially required AA meetings or life skill classes, so trying to save up to get out of a bad situation actually prevents a lot of homeless people from utilizing shelters. Additionally, there are unfortunately several shelters that will turn away LGBTQ+ individuals (whom make up about 40% of homeless teens), mentally ill people, and/or disabled people (often for insurance reasons or because they can't provide accommodations). While I can't say for sure whether or not these are issues at your local shelter, these are just a handful of the many reasons homeless people might prefer sleeping outside to a shelter."
