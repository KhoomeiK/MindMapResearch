mentalhealth,fpqya75,t3_gey2d6,1588835970.0,"I'm similar.  A few years ago, I had the best times of my life.  Now I am unhappy and miserable.  Of course I dream that 2015 would just be here again and I could relive those times where I was the most happy I've been in my life.  But.... I can't.  I know what your feeling.  I also wish I could completely start my life over and try to make it turn out happier...but I can't.  

I feel ya."
mentalhealth,fpqxld3,t3_gezlka,1588835336.0,"He sounds like he wants to use you.  I've never treated a girl like this but I've been around to guys that do.  If he wants to have sex with you this fast, yeah he can careless about you as a person and care more for the sex part.  I'd stay away. He's just a horny little punk.  Just block him.  A good guy will give you attention because he likes you as a person! Sure he will also like other aspects, but to like you as a person should be the ultimate factor.  Find yourself a better guy, you deserve it!  

Good luck"
