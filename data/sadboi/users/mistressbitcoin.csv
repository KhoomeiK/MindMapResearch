investing,fpszlvq,t1_fpska8l,1588882314.0,"I think you and many other people are thinking about this the wrong way. It is tempting to say ""Bitcoin costs $X to mine, so should be worth around $X. After the halving it will cost $2X to mine, so the price can double"". This argument is weak because something being expensive to create does not necessarily mean it needs to be worth what it costs to create it.

The better way to look at it is through cash flows. How much money, on average, is flowing into bitcoin per month? How many bitcoins are being sold off per month (from miners + existing owners)?

Since late 2017, about 2.5 years ago, the average price of bitcoin is somewhere between $7k and $9k - lets call it $8k. Currently about 50k bitcoins are being mined per month. At $8k per bitcoin, that is $400m worth of bitcoin. Over 2.5 years, that is $12 billion worth of bitcoin. Miners received roughly $12 billion worth of bitcoin (at the moment they mined it) over this time frame. This constant supply from miners tends to suppress the price until equilibrium between buyers/sellers is met.

The price today ($9900) is higher than the average price over the last 2.5 years. Putting this together, it means that at least $12 billion needed to enter the market to absorb miner supply (if we count miners' long term holdings as investment inflow, which we should).

Now we have this halving event which will drop the production to 25k btc per month. Now we only need investment inflows of $6 billion to hold the price above $8k for the next 2.5 years. But if we expect $12 billion of investment inflows over this time (simplest guess is to assume the same investment inflow rate), investors will demand more than miners can mine, and will need to purchase from existing holders. This pushes the price up until miners + existing holders can supply $12 billion worth of BTC over the next 2.5 years. The ""existing holders"" part  makes it much less straightforward than just assuming prices will double.

Some interesting data just came out that Cashapp + Grayscale investment fund bought the equivalent of half of all newly mined bitcoin during the first quarter this year. If that rate continues, they alone will be able to buy all bitcoins being mined once the halving happens. Forget about people buying on coinbase, bitstamp, etc.

Interesting times for bitcoin - up around 40% YTD while US stocks are down 10-15%. Many people had assumed that if stocks faltered and we entered a recession, bitcoin would be the first thing to crash and burn. But, with the exception of that huge liqidation in March from over-leveraged traders, this has so far been proven incorrect."

1: Have you tried self publishing? The most successful author I know self published his book and sells primarily to his online followers who follow his blog. He even admits that his book is ""bad"", but is probably just super self critical. There is also Amazon.

2: I am also writing a book - it is a finance-ish book. This genre gets a lot of hate. I have not published it yet but i know i have to go in with an extremely thick skin. I will self publish it and will probably hire a digital advertising company.

3: Even if it never comes to anything, i'm sure there are a lot of positive things you learned from this experience. Just the fact that you finished it is more than most aspiring authors can say. Perhaps you can concentrate on those positives more? Or at least not ignore them. I wish I could write a horror book. I used to be a good fiction writer (well in elementary school, lol), and I regret ignoring it.

4: Almost everyone ""whores themselves out"" whether figuratively or literally. Either you sell your body where you have to stay in tip-top shape (military / construction worker / stripper) or figuratively where you let yourself go sitting in a cubicle for 40 years stressing out over spreadsheets. It's just a sad fact of this world. Try to find something to enjoy in the chaos.

5: It is incredibly rare to become as successful as JK Rowling. What else compares? Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones come to mind. That is a total of three people over a quarter of a century and nobody can ever bank on those odds. But there is a lot of room between being the best and doing nothing. Hundreds of thousands of people live between those extremes who consider themselves successful.  There are also a lot of people who hate the movies I mentioned.

BombToken,fnsvus3,t3_g385s3,1587229778.0,"I like this idea, perhaps one way of controlling the burn would be like this:

The contract executes once every day or X number of blocks. Everyone who sends Bomb to the contract address has a chance of receiving the 10 Bomb (or another amount as a reward) in proportion to how many Bomb they sent. The contract will also burn the same number of Bomb as were sent to it.

So if 15 people each send 1 Bomb each, the contract burns an additional 15 Bomb and sends 10 Bomb to one of the 15 people who sent Bomb to the contract.

In your suggestion where the contract is locked for N blocks and only 1 (or a few) people can call it, I am worried that it will be gamed by bots. Especially if the EV is positive - and I think a positive EV is necessary to attract people.

In my hypothetical contract above, the EV is slightly negative beginning with 10 people, and will become more negative as more people participate. This could be mitigated with a dynamic capped reward; perhaps the reward can be set as 10 Bomb + number of Bomb sent to the contract, capped at a maximum reward of 100. So the reward in my example would be 25 Bomb. The cap prevents someone rich from wiping out the entire contract at once.

I think the main questions to ask are: ""To what extent should this look like a casino game"", and ""How is this better than just straight of burning Bomb tokens"". Hopefully the answer to #2 is that it attracts new people to Bomb. Perhaps the answer to #1 is a disclaimer that Bomb sent to the contract must be considered gone and express purpose of the transaction was to force the additional burn.

Perhaps 5k Bomb would be a good amount. That should be enough to keep it running at least a couple months."
