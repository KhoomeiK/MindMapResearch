I really enjoyed it and i decided to do my research and began watching the TOS and watched some of the animated series before they got rid of it on Netflix. I finshed TOS now I and on TNG and I am in loveeeee with the next generations. So far I'm done with season 1 so far. If it wasn't for the JJ movie I would have never gotten into star trek. Like I'm obsessed and ready to explore more into the series."

I was put in his group by the teacher and i began to draw. He told me that i drew really well and it looked awesome. It was the first time a person complaint my art since my parents were against it since it took away from studying. Because of it i began to draw more and more. We talked about drawing, art, and cartoons. We got to know each  other more and I grew to like him alot and we are currently dating, and my parents now let me do what i am passionate about as long as I doing well in school."
AskReddit,esk1uft,t3_c85lie,1562048587.0,"Not talking enough to my cousin, he passed away in a car accident in the beginning of this year. I really loved him. We were in different states but we grew up together. I visited him and his family alot. I saw him as my big brother, i was an only child for most of my early childhood. He made me happy and made me forget of my worries for at lest a little while which was great. I enjoyed it. After my big 15 party we didn't talk since i got too busy with school and high school stuff. But I'll never forget how shitty i felt when i realized i only really loved him other than my other cousins (his brothers). Eveytime i visited i only looked forward to him. Sadly now i hope we can try to overcome these and support his brothers and his parents."

AmItheAsshole,eqlfhrn,t3_byp65g,1560143422.0,"I personally think your NTA because it was her mistake. She will most likely not trust you after this. Her sneaking out was her decision, no one else is in fault of her action. As a teen myself, I believe that she made a dumb decision going.  You have your own life and your own responsibilities. It was her choice to go out and party and drink. You didn't need to go for her. I think you did the right choice by calling your parents. They must have been closer to her and would of gotten her out of there quicker. I think it good she is going to get punished for partying and drinking, but I hope she can learn to be responsible and more smarter with her actions for future decisions making. I grew up with relaxed parents but they have taught me to accept my mistakes and grow wiser from them. So I hope she can understand why her actions are reasonable with her punishment."
