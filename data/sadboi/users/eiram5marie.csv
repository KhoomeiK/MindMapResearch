AskTeenGirls,fn1u954,t1_fn1rggq,1586570246.0,i’m sry this is really triggering me. I have tried to commit suicide bc of pmsing and have thrown up from pain before. i am an extreme example of pain and emotions. u are the extreme if experiencing neither of those things. i will not go around saying most people have suicidal thoughts and throw up from pain on their period just because i do. u should not go around saying most ppl have “normal periods” just because u do. and making fun of it and say we’re over dramatic is insulting. 80% of women experience period cramps sometime in their life so i don’t know why u think most girls have “normal periods” which in ur opinion means no pain and no mood swings. thank you for listening to my ted-talk.

teenagers,flpr0nh,t3_fq6iuo,1585366424.0,i like this because it’s something i wish i had heard sooner. I used to be a huge jerk to everyone and i was confident because i had always heard that i should need to change myself. I would be rude and say hurtful things to people and think it was totally fine because i was “being myself” which is what everyone says we should be. I had the worst anger issues and would sooooo over dramatic about nothing. I was really just a brat and thought it was completely accept. But then during the summer leading to 6th grade i looked at how i acted and treated people and suddenly realized what a horrible person i was. So over summer i worked on improving myself. Now i have a lot more friends and am a completely different person. I think it’s good to encourage people to love themselves but to tell people that they don’t need to change is bs. Everyone can improve especially the people who don’t think they do. So it’s important to reflect but not hate. I’m still not perfect or even close but i know now that i treats people better i will be happier.

That’s definitely one thing i would not be able to handle. Also if i just want to flirt with someone i couldn’t do that and would somehow end up in jail for harassment. As a female who has been assaulted i still know the difference between a compliment, an accidental arm touch, and actual harassment and assault. One last thing i personally wouldn’t be able to handle is you “have to be stronger physically” (once again society said it not me). I am a twig and which is more acceptable for a girl. I personally believe boys and girls have it equally as difficult in life.

Edit: i also didn’t say anything about having to make the first move or paying for everything because i made the first move with my boyfriend and we pay equally for everything, but i do realize those are also to points that most boys deal with."
