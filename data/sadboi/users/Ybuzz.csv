Anyone in a medical position is naturally held to a higher standard of professionalism than many people, but especially those dealing with potentially embarrassing, delicate and, yes potentially traumatic experiences of having a stranger deal with your genitals. 

It is entirely unacceptable for a comment like that to just 'slip out' and if it did, then she should have owned up to that on the spot. ""I'm sorry, that wasn't very well worded. I only meant... (Does it hurt to remove hair?/I noticed it's different, is there a reason?)"" 

I don't support people, especially women, most especially women in a position of deep trust and power, who put other women down and make them feel shitty. _That's_ what's toxic, and should be called out when you see it. 

Honestly, given my past experience, I'm not sure if I would have had a panic attack or just got dressed and walked straight out. Depends how much therapy I had done to even be in that room. 

The gyno wouldn't know that person's individual experience - what if they'd had an abusive relationship filled with judgemental comments like that? What if they were already feeling vulnerable due to trauma? What if, they are just an average, mentally healthy person, who's feeling vulnerable simply because they're in pain?

I was just getting out of a really tough slump - failed a degree a few years back, worked in a crushing office job for years, untreated anxiety was barely under control but I was just starting to rebuild some self esteem after finally getting Invisalign braces to straighten my awful teeth. 

I had made that year my 'year of self improvement'. Took me six months to make that appointment with the dentist, but by December I was well into treatment and feeling so much happier about myself. So at 2am, after coming home from an office Christmas party that, for the first time, I had actually had a good time at, I posted on the lesbianr4r sub. 

My idea was to 'dip my toe' into the waters of online dating, because I was still so uncomfortable with pictures - I had tried to download a few apps and could never get past that 'upload some photos of yourself!' stage. 

A few lovely people messaged me and we chatted for a bit, but I also got this really long, deeply honest message from a woman who just seemed... I'm not even sure how to put it. She was eloquent, and she'd checked my post history and brought up things she was interested by. It just seemed so genuine. 

Our messages became these long letters that took hours to read and respond to. We had so much to talk about we had to drop threads to make way for all the new conversations. 

I felt completely mad  - I was getting so excited every time I saw the message notification. I mean, I didn't even know this woman! What if I was just kidding myself and this was all just a nice chat for her, and she wasn't feeling what I was? What if she didn't even exist? It was equal parts wonderful and terrifying. 

Eventually we moved to Reddit chat, and then traded numbers and emails and actual real life proof of existence! Pretty clear once we moved to real time chatting that as well as being intellectually and romantically compatible we were also... Other kinds of compatible. 

By Christmas we were officially dating. I was still so shy about myself I was shaking as I recorded her a Merry Christmas voice message. But she never pushed. It must have been so nerve-wracking for her - 'doesn't want to video chat or call' is a massive red flag for being catfished online.

But she gave me time, encouraged me, and eventually we started doing video chats, discord dates, and then, a couple of months after we met she _got on a plane_ for me to a hotel in my little island, because I was too scared to fly alone. She did an intensive physio course to prepare because her health wasn't great, and then just packed her bags and flew across an ocean, just for me. It was insanely risky and I'm pretty sure she was half certain she'd wake up in an ice bath minus a kidney, but she took that chance on us. 

We spent an entire long weekend in a hotel room, and never got sick of eachother. Not for a minute. We talked just as much IRL as we did online. 

Long story short - I quit my job, she convinced me to follow my dreams and become an art student in her town, so I moved in. Somewhere in all that we decided life was too short to not grab the things you want with both hands, so we got engaged. 

Now I'm sitting in her living room, wearing her ring, we've been quarantined together for over 5 weeks and I am just blissfully happy and grateful for her every single day."

AskWomen,fol1ewl,t1_fok7plf,1587852986.0,"The main genetic difference they can look at for breast cancer is a mutation to the [BRCA](https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/what-is-brca)  gene (sometimes called 'Braca gene' when spoken) you can, I think, find out about it even from those genetic ancestry kits like 23&Me? (I looked it up and they do check for the most common variants to that gene, but not _all_ variants) 

It's not a certainty that someone with that mutation will get cancer, but it makes certain forms more likely - mutations to brca cause predisposition to aggressive breast cancers, but there are other genetic markers you can be tested for."

Coronavirus,fo3b4co,t1_fo25s8d,1587483854.0,"Their being young may have meant that they didn't seek help until it was too late (not that there is much help, other than alleviating the symptoms and treating other infections at the moment). 

Having underlying conditions makes it more likely that you'll be affected badly, but it's not a guarantee, and likewise, being younger and healthy is not a guarantee of safety. 

Remember that it's not necessarily Covid that kills you - your body can spend such a long time fighting it off that, by the time you are starting to recover, your immune system is exhausted and open to other infections like viral pneumonia. Not to mention that your lungs can be in very bad shape afterwards.

They didn't say, but it's possible they were both smokers, or had mild asthma, little things that we might not think make you higher risk, but can really have an effect on how long your body is able to fight this thing and how strong your immune system will be afterwards, if you win."

She was many things and one of them was quite obviously bisexual - to suggest she didn't have time to find that out is to suggest that one can be 'too young' to be LGBT (when no one ever says you are 'too young' to be straight).

It also negates her role in helping other young people discover their sexuality - Anne was the first account I had ever read of a woman who was attracted to women. She is an icon for me. Her strength and personality in her writing inspired me and she was an icon for me in several ways, not just her bisexuality, but as a young queer woman, seeing a strong bisexual finding herself in her own words was formative."

As long as they are handled gently, they are okay. It's just that shipping companies aren't always reliable. In the days when post was pretty fast and and not so plentiful and delivery drivers weren't worked to the bone it worked okay. 

But on the whole I do agree. It's one thing to transport animals yourself or with a trained transporter (my grandfather used to race pigeons and they had a guy who took them on the ferry, drove them through France etc to be released, who knew pigeons and would stop to check on them, feed them etc), but it's quite another to ship them with a standard postal company that happens to allow live animals in amongst their thousands of Amazon packages."
