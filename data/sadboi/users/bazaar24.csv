schizoaffective,f1y5an0,t3_db2nfs,1569809685.0,"I began seeing a doctor at 14 for OCD and adhd like behavior, and just remember how obsessed I would be with peculiar things. At that time I didnt think much of those thoughts...I was diagnosed schizoaffective a few years back, and became more aware of synchronicities and subliminals. At first I thought everyone must be thinking this, but the more I voiced these kind of thoughts to my friends and family and doctor the more I realized it was just me . Unfortunately, during the peak of all that, around 19-20, I started abusing drugs and my hallucinations and subliminal messages got so deep, and so apparent. So I was in lots of meds and in and out of psych.
Fast forward to now, 24. I have been clean 2 years, haven't really been to a doctor for meds, and haven't been admitted. But there are so many... so many subliminals that stick with me today. I cant help but think, how that cant be true, or how certain things from those years played out for a reason, how everyone isnt in on this, how if I make the wrong move or say thing, someone will catch on and play this game against me in the same way as everyone else that is a part of the 'delusion' I believe. Sure I dont get the AV hallucinations as much, but my paranoia is still there.  
Some days I just cant take it, and I dont want to do it anymore. It's hard. It's hard especially when i dont have much to say about this to anyone who will truly understand. 
The past couple years, i just got back in back in college, got a better job, and did a lot to keep my mind busy. I feel overworked with how much I take on, but I honestly rather be stressed over work and school and helping my family than sit in my delusional brain. I am convinced though, that these types of thoughts will never leave my head. I dont know how I cant think of certain things this way. But staying distracted has helped.
I just want to tell you to stay strong, and try to take the messages in the best way as you can. This shit sucks, but we are very strong. Our minds are powerful. Best of luck to you in everything, and reach out to me if you ever just want to talk or get something out."

Using methamphetamine has changed my perspective on everything. I thought I looked so beautiful on it, and now I look in the mirror and think I need to lose weight, or my eyes to be bigger, or my skin to look ""clear"", even though I looked 30x worse while I was on it. I was never hungry on it, and now my appetite is huge, and I just want to starve myself. I have dreams and flashbacks about my use with it, and I wake up thinking it's something I'm still doing and I feel upset when I realize it was just in my head. I got used to staying up all night running off of 20 seconds of sleep and now I have work and school and have the fucked up yearn to still be tired and sleep deprived. I had to move so mysteriously and watch my back, and I still feel like I have to consistently look in my rearview to see if I'm being followed, and freak out when I see cops who could search so deep in to me they would find nothing but my obsession with the drug.  Every move I make, every thought I have, everywhere I look, I relate it back to methamphetamine. I've done opiates, crack, etc on a daily basis, but nothing has affected me the way ice did. It's like sometimes I'll just be sitting there and still feel like I get a rush through out my body, and my teeth clench up, and my heart races. 
One thing I can take away from it positively, is learning how to sit through pain and fear. I sat through delusion and abuse, and I fought through the confusion and sense of doom even though I had no idea I was fighting through it. I thought I was losing..... Today, after being clean for some time, I realize how much I got through, and how much further I can go with out it, no matter how close I feel to losing...."

I chanced my luck too many times, and I'm scared to keep trying it. It took me a while and a lot of relapses to realize it.... I've been clean for some time now, and I just get the chills thinking of some of the sketchy situations I was in and fear I felt."
