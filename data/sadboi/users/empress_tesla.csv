And honestly, her behavior shows that she’s likely jealous that you have a full chest and is taking her own insecurities out on you. Just wow.

Whether that’s paying bills, doing housework, raising children, etc. Your actions prove that you are not mature enough or ready for a long term committed relationship.

Anxiety,fo7edik,t3_g5zaev,1587576907.0,"I do and it helps me immensely. You have to be selective which strains you use. Indicas are typically the best for anxiety. I smoke some about an hour before bed every night. It helps my brain calm down and helps me sleep. Otherwise my anxiety keeps me awake. I’ve been tracking my anxiety for a few years now and just started smoking within the last year. I went from having about 12 panic attacks a month on average to less than 1 a month. And some months I don’t even have one. It also helps with my other general anxiety symptoms. But it takes some trial and error to find a strain that works the best for you. Take it slow and remember that any negative effect you’re experiencing will only last about an hour. And don’t give up because you use one strain that didn’t agree with you. There’s hundreds of strains to choose from. And if you’ve never smoked before, start out with the lowest recommended amount. If you’re using edibles, start with 5mg. If you’re smoking flower, start with only 1-2 hits. You also want to look specifically for strains with a higher CBD content. That helps reduce the psychoactive effects of THC that can actually cause anxiety and paranoia. Leafly.com (they have an app to) is a really good place to start researching possible strains."

If she was older and knew how to spell and already had a sense of Polish culture then I would say you should leave the spelling as is.

unpopularopinion,ett1r3j,t3_cd8lie,1563161826.0,Why can’t Hollywood (modern films/tv in general) create something new and have the new character represent what they want without having to change pre-existing stories? Are they that unimaginative? I am so bored of seeing the same shit being done over and over with a forcible wokeness that just ends up leaving me feeling like they are doing it solely for how much money they make rather than because they legitimately feel strongly about representing minorities and women.

Portland,eqoy1rh,t1_eqovf77,1560193804.0,"Well, you still committed an illegal act and should reap the consequences regardless of whether knowingly doing it or not. Perhaps the fines should be scaled based on income, like a percentage or something. That would help alleviate the strain on the poor while also impressing the importance of following the law regardless of income level. The problem with getting rid of parking tickets is that it’ll cause chaos and unsafe streets for other drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and locals living in the area."
Portland,eqon9hu,t1_eqokhgn,1560190486.0,It pays for the roads we use as well.
Portland,eqohg5w,t3_byypj2,1560188592.0,"I’m sorry, but if you can’t afford to pay a ticket maybe don’t do the illegal act in the first place. Laws, fines and consequences exist for a reason."
