AskCentralAsia,euc8kxq,t3_cfr04l,1563668054.0,"Speaking on behalf of Uzbekistan, I think it’s best to introduce a female perspective on this matter. The country is far from being progressive on women’s rights as compared to westernized countries. It is true that women do hold somewhat of considerable role in the workforce and that there are women professionals. However, it is also true that there is a double standard that a women needs to put her family first before her work unless she is from a wealthy/upper-class background that is in which there is a bit more leeway.

If you want to talk economic-wise, there is sex segregation in job roles. In response to another user that says otherwise, as of 2018, women make up only 16% of parliament. 

In the social sphere, women are objectified in the sense that their value is determined by their purity (i.e virginity) and their contribution to the household as a wife (e.g. bearing children, fulfilling domestic tasks, etc). This is unlike the situation of men who are free to fool around before settling down. There is the tradition of arranged marriage where, for women coming of age, marriage is delegated as their first priority lest they become an “old maid” and an outcast in the community. This expectation is not upheld for men who are free to pursue their education and career before marrying. 

This sort of social disparity can be best illustrated by the presence of domestic violence between husband and wife, an issue that is even government-sponsored as the police refuse to take violence against women seriously,  blame the victim saying that the husband has a reason to beat the wife, and make their first priority not the safety of the victim but rather the reconciliation of the marriage. Not to mention, the women is even shamed by the community for reporting such a situation.

Do you feel like you’re always being interrogated even though you know you did nothing wrong? Are your parents controlling over your life?

I don’t know why this is considered “lying” when he isn’t faking his personality to his date. Think of it the other way around; if OP actively chose to flaunt his wealth and use that to boost himself, that’s misrepresentation. What’s actually sexist is him being put in a double bind: he’s “lying” if he tries to be modest or he’s shallow if he isn’t. 

I read OP’s recent posts and I’m from a culture similar to that of India’s (OP’s country) where material worth and utility is more important than character when it comes to dating and marriage (which is often considered to be arranged in some ways). Hence, it’s totally reasonable as to why OP would want to go around those boundaries and seek a meaningful relationship not built on what one can financially provide for the other."
