Anxiety,fqpgkxb,t3_gk71ol,1589545863.0,"After 8 weeks in isolation, went out to see a friend last night (allowed where I am) and promptly had a panic attack within about an hour of meeting. Chest pains, fast heart, impending doom. I had to excuse myself and make up an excuse about going out to take a call. 45 minutes later I had calmed down but had to leave.

Previously fun situations are now something I dread. I won't have a panic attack all the time but I'm more on edge always.

What's it like? It's exhausting. I want my life back."
Anxiety,fqllrqp,t3_gjdvv5,1589461241.0,"I really feel you.

The single thing that has helped me the most is walks. Long walks. Whether it's with podcasts or music, just go and get outside. Breathe. Say hello to people. Try and smile. You might be surprised. I made a habit, until COVID, of setting out every Saturday for a long walk. It became a habit.

Meditation can be good too and you may surprise yourself. I've done some guided ones on YouTube that made me very emotional. ASMR videos help me sleep.

I know what you mean about the foods. I've found that deep fried stuff sets me off. I can't enjoy meals like I used to.

But I am slowly getting better, and learning more about myself, even if I had a setback of a panic attack today.

Keep at it, you've got this."

Also left me quite a few SMS messages. I basically told them to go jump.  Surprisingly, they left me alone after a while.

costochondritis,fp580mf,t3_gb4wnh,1588319522.0,"I probably had a degree of anxiety before I got costo and never really took action on the signs. Costo has definitely made life worse. Life hasn't been the same since my first major panic attack. Damn it sucks. Hard to know sometimes if my chest is tight because of costo or anxiety. At least now I know the signs. Doesn't make sleeping at night any easier.

Until recently, I had a pretty good period of little to no pain. Since isolation costo and anxiety have been markedly worse."
costochondritis,fomyfh7,t3_g7sv1z,1587907589.0,"I had a pretty bad cold/sinus problem after I returned from abroad last year. I had a pressure at the bottom of my sternum/connecting rib that just wouldn't go away, no improvement after a couple of weeks. Sure enough, went to the ER and all was fine, but my doctor eventually diagnosed costo after ruling other things out and reproducing the pains by pushing on my ribs. I've had it all. Sternum, back, lower rib pain.

I stopped posting here because it improved but with immobility at home the last few weeks I think it's back. It is quite a misunderstood inflammation so if it is costo, be prepared potentially, to be screwed around by doctors or them not taking it seriously. I pretty much had to give up lifting and the really intense workouts I did.

There are enough people here who've had it chronically to show that taking a bunch of ibuprofen won't make it go away in many cases.

It may not be costo, who knows, but I hope for your sake things improve soon."

I've written here before that I was having really bad dizziness, brain fog, and persistent headaches and head pressure a few weeks ago. It's mostly gone away now. I had it for more than 4 weeks in Nov-Dec last year and thought it would never go away. It was awful. I had to take weeks off work. But somehow, someday, I woke up and it was gone, or I wasn't paying attention to it and it was gone.

These days I seem to be dealing with other things, but my brain fog and fatigue seems to be ok. Swings and roundabouts."
Anxiety,fmz9jdo,t1_fmwfn7z,1586511782.0,"Yep. In some form or another, and to varying degrees. I've probably had about 2 weeks in the last year when I felt really, really good and my anxiety was under control. I'm not sure which came first really, the anxiety or the costo, and as you know, there's no test for costo, it's a judgment made by a doctor after ruling everything else out, so that kind of adds to the uncertainty.

The year has just been a grind, all starting from costo. My chest was on fire in the first few months but it has calmed down a lot. I've learnt to live with it too. The backpod is the only thing that helps and I notice if I don't use it for a few days.

Anxiety,fmwf5dj,t1_fmw6i2m,1586445469.0,"It's the absolute worst. I'd never heard of it but man it sucks. I had it real bad for about 6 months. It floored me. I spent so much money on scans and tests trying to figure out what was wrong and they all came back perfectly fine.

I had to give up lifting and swimming. I was so depressed that those things had been taken away from me. The worst was nights in bed and my sternum would just burn until I was so exhausted I'd fall asleep.

Not many doctors seem to know much about it or say stuff like take ibuprofen and you'll be fine.

It's consistently 80% better but I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to workout the same again."
Anxiety,fmvpqpq,t3_fxoae9,1586426129.0,"Hi there. Absolutely, I've been having routine physical freak outs in the afternoon almost everyday for the past couple of weeks. I don't know what it is, maybe something about the existential dread of spending another night in and just looking at the same view. My dizziness and random headaches seem to have returned too. It's okay. Try and reassure yourself, and distraction is key. Have something to look forward to. I had my freak out at about 3pm. I had a webinar at 4pm. By the time I prepared myself for the webinar and it went down, I was much better.

On costochondritis, my doctor suspected this in me about May last year. I tried everything for months. It was probably the main physical reason I suspected something bad was happening in my chest. The only thing that has really worked is the backpod device, available online. It really has helped me. I'm now at the stage where constant chest pain does not rule my everyday, but of course I still struggle with physical anxiety. I recommend to join the Reddit costochondritis community for support and if you want to have a chat about it, send me a message anytime. It's a little known condition but can be chronic and debilitating if you don't get on top of it.

Sending you much warmth."
Anxiety,fmkslov,t3_fvuuq6,1586167035.0,"Hi there. I had them for months and months, since about November last year. They would come and go for weeks. There was no real pattern and nothing in particular like caffeine would trigger them. The only thing was overeating which seemed to bring them on worse. I went to ER on a bad night and had an ECG, bloods and urine work done. Totally fine. Also had a 24 hour monitor on that confirmed they were PVCs. Weirdly they've gone away the last few weeks of isolation - knock on wood.

I had them pretty bad and they were annoying as hell, especially while trying to sleep. They've been replaced with other symptoms, but yeah, they are a common symptom of anxiety. I get its hard not to focus on them. They will hopefully go away in time, just try to look after yourself as best as you can."

Anxiety,fmgjwsa,t3_fv57ow,1586050680.0,"Yes, in fact spasms in my chest and chest pain are what initially triggered me. Spasms are usually in pectoral muscles, ab muscles, or up near collarbone.

I was told to take magnesium and keep hydrated which I do but they still happen."
Anxiety,fmcw38h,t3_fufb84,1585953995.0,"Hi there, I just wanted to say some words of support. I know how you feel and still vividly remember my first panic attack 18 months ago, alone at night. It really was scary and started from disturbances in my chest. I live alone so decided to take myself to the nearest ER and like you, did the heart tests and everything which were totally fine. I remember being a shaking wreck upon going home and feeling so exhausted like I had a massive workout. It was about 5 months until my next major attack. Almost 100% of my attacks have happened at night and I feel worse at night in general. The mind wanders at night and we feel more vulnerable in bed, so keep that in mind.

You may or may not have more but you will learn from them and how to manage your body. I've had almost every physical symptom under the sun and tell myself that after 18 months I'm still here, have ran so many tests, but the battle is fought in the mind. Just remember that you got through it and now it's about trying to take care of yourself and making some improvements in life. If it happens again, you can get through it :)"

Probably why my sleep has been so poor as I don't feel I've accomplished a whole lot. On the plus side I've only had food delivery once and have cooked more than I ever have at home. I do like the feeling of thinking that I don't have to be anywhere and there is no pressure on myself to go out for the sake of being out."

I was having palpitations for a good few months, but they have subsided the last few weeks (eek, I hope). Recently have developed a weird buzzing in my chest, even when my heart rate is perfectly normal. I can't quite put my finger on it, it's near my sternum and comes and goes.

My sleeping has been awful recently. Have had muscle pains and twitches, stomach and digestive issues, headaches, shortness of breath, hot and cold flushes, weird feelings like I'm about to fall over/lose control, jerks in my muscles while falling asleep, you name it all over the last year.

The most frustrating thing is that when something goes, something else happens. Almost a year to the day since my biggest panic attack and a realisation that I might actually have anxiety. What a fucking up and down journey."

All of this sucks because I love coffee."

I may just take next week off if we don't go into lockdown by then.

I have a really tight chest and just finished a bit of a shaking session, along with high heart rate. Have managed to calm myself down. Sleeping has been hard. I really should stop looking at Twitter so much and stats. It doesn't help.

It's hard to avoid media about it because that's basically all we hear about if we switch on the radio.

Anxiety,fcxqaxx,t1_fcx9pgt,1578068922.0,"That's a great question. I had my first panic attack in November 2018, after coming back home after a work conference in another state. On the surface, life was good, I should have been happier, but I was troubled for years. My work had been dicking me around with contract extensions, but it was probably a mixture of work stuff plus becoming my age (early 30s), single, living alone, and feeling pretty lost in life. I was always pretty indifferent, ponderous, and good at my job but always socially awkward etc.

I got sick and one night alone at home, felt something in my chest which suddenly became a panic attack. I brushed it off and was fine until April when I had two major panic attacks again. I haven't really recovered after those, my body has just been 'different'.

I've controlled my panic attacks to some extent, following a lot of tests (which have drained my pocket and emotions) and the fact I've had my symptoms for a long time (hey, if they haven't got me yet...)

This year I'm looking to leave my apartment and maybe change my job. Fresh surroundings might help me. I've started walking a little more but haven't had the courage to try a full on workout again, and god I miss it."
Anxiety,fcx4omz,t3_ejcql7,1578051084.0,"Thank you for the post! This is almost exactly what I've been going through for about two months. I had a history of anxiety and chest pains related to costochondritis/anxiety and like you went to the doctor to have all manner of tests done. I've been to the ER three times in a year.

My heart palpitations started in early November, but unlike you, they just came out of nowhere when I was lying on my bed. I used to go to the gym and lift/work out about three times a week and have hardly been back since my first symptoms of chest pain started in April. Now with the palpitations, it feels extremely uncomfortable to do rigorous exercise and even a brisk walk. It's very disconcerting. I almost broke down in front of my doctor when he said all the tests were normal, simply because I don't know what to do.

An ER doctor essentially said that I shouldn't let the symptoms control me and seemed almost frustrated that I'd presented three times in a year. Yeah, thanks doc. Easy to say when your heart is not jumping around all over the place and you're home alone at night. The ectopic beats come and go and nothing in particular seems to trigger them. I've barely had any caffeine since November. Haven't really noticed a cough.

Like you, I also have all manner of random chest pains, twitches, and a tight chest. I've also become very aware of my heartbeat. I'd give anything to feel 'normal' again and have a normal gym session like I used to. In fact, I'd give anything just for a 'normal' day at work or out socialising. People don't understand and it seems like my doctor is at a loss. It just sucks.

I'm sorry I can't offer any real practical advice, I just wanted to let you know that I definitely relate and you are not alone. Feel free get in touch should you need to chat anytime."
costochondritis,fcud54n,t1_fcjdr7m,1577978168.0,"Definitely, the sense of feeling dismissed and helpless sucks. I looked back at last year since my diagnosis and life just felt different, like this thing was always there and preventing me from truly enjoying life. I went out to work and to life as usual but nobody could understand what I was going through. I didn't even tell my family until they noticed I put on a bit of weight from not exercising. I live alone too so it's hard not to notice my body and what I feel.

The heart palpitations have slowly gotten better but they're still there. I did a 24 hour ECG monitor which showed benign ectopic beats. My doctor didn't think it would be too much benefit to go to a cardiologist at the moment given the tests I'd done. Hoping for improvement and will definitely consider my referral to a rheumatologist if things continue. Hoping for a much better year though!

Oh, and one thing I did which I know can be hard for some people - stop Googling symptoms and go to a medical professional and get tests done. It will help."

The palpitations and chest pain were really annoying and one night, my heart rate rocketed up and I just had to go. My chest was really tight. Doctor in emergency tried to reassure me but I felt like I was being spoken down to as I had presented three times in a year with similar symptoms. Well, we are told to seek medical attention with bad chest pains, aren't we?

He did full blood and urine work, and another ECG. I raised costo and he said no, that's managed with paracetamol and ibuprofen... why does this thinking still persist! Results were absolutely fine.

Anyway, I don't have so much rib cage pain anymore but continue to battle anxiety. I think that's what I'm trying to get over now. Even though the doctor was dismissive of costo in general he stressed to make sure that symptoms don't take over my life. Easier said than done. Hope you are all ok."

One day I can wake up and have an almost pain free day, and the next day I'll have sharp pains and all sorts of strange feelings in my chest, which are partly fuelled by anxiety I believe.

As another poster alluded to, do you have any anxiety or depression issues? My costo symptoms began in April. However I had anxiety symptoms that were getting worse going back to November last year. It's not that I ignored them, but I should have gotten on top of them sooner and taken better care of myself. Some of those issues were panic attacks (which I don't have anymore), light headedness (sometimes still have), and low energy (depends on the day).

Now I'm stuck with costo and anxiety (which admittedly has gotten better following a bunch of tests and a better work situation) and it's been a heck of a challenge. Look after yourself as best you can, physically and mentally, and I'm sure things will improve."
costochondritis,ev1k6v3,t3_chtdnu,1564160078.0,"Have been using mine since last Monday, so that's about a week and a half. Twice a day, for 5-10 minutes each time. It takes a bit of getting used to, but the feeling overall is a good one and I actually enjoy lying on it. It's a 'good' pain.

I have definitely felt better since using it. Less intense pain and symptoms overall. Also curious to see how I feel after the three to four week mark."
China,ev1jdt5,t3_ci12od,1564159623.0,"Kaohsiung is the second largest city in Taiwan and a major trading port in Asia, it is not provincial. His winning the mayor race in Kaohsiung was a huge shock, the city had been DPP for 20-25 years previously. Another populist elected on shallow slogans, I really hope he does not win and the people of Taiwan are not fooled."
costochondritis,euklkiu,t3_cgnhai,1563889968.0,"That's great, I'm glad to hear. I went to a chiro last month who had no experience with it and was a bit dismissive of it. Big mistake on my part and lack of research about him, but the adjustment he did felt damn good and he commented on how tight my upper back was. I've been using the backpod for one week and have felt a little better consistently. It's still sore but in a good way. The first time I laid down on it there were some really good cracks in my spine. I've gone to a myotherapist/remedial therapist for work as well.

The weekend was the first time in ages that I actually felt like I had very little pain. I've noticed flare ups after drinking coffee at work so will be looking to cut that out, for a while at least. I stopped taking meloxicam as it was doing weird things to my stomach. Cardio or exercise? Forget it. At least I feel I am making some very slow progress."
costochondritis,etqwqgd,t3_ccgsfd,1563105263.0,"Now onto month three. No noticeable improvement. It's wearing me down a lot. I find the time with the least amount of pain is after a good night's sleep. Today it's more in the sternum, a few days ago was more the left ribs. It's bizarre. The mental mindfuckery is just as bad as the pain. Can't agree more with others. It just sucks and has sucked worse than anything I've had. I travel a bit for work so the constant movement/sitting in an airplane doesn't help.

I've had maybe one or two hopeful weeks of less pain but then bang, it's back. Have been taking supplements but no real difference. I tried to go for a jog last week but I just ran out of gas too quickly. It felt like there was a big ball near my sternum. It's been tough but we have to keep reading, learning new things.

I want my life back and am determined to get it. I ordered the backpod last week and am looking forward to trying it."
costochondritis,er8am1b,t3_c0h8ys,1560600317.0,"Sorry to hear but please hang in there as I'm trying to do! I was diagnosed in late April following strange chest pains. I came back from abroad and following some anxiety issues the pains haven't gone away. I took myself to the ER and was reassured a bit after they let me go.

I've maybe had one week of minimal pain since then but the rest of the time I've been in some pretty dark places. Can't lift or barely exercise. It's been very frustrating and frankly, exhausting. I've found that having purpose on a task or social interaction has helped with distraction.

I've also had a stress test, ECG, and x-rays which have been clear. Yet to win the battle of the mind and nothing has really worked so far. I'm going to try and cut out caffeine and make a conscious effort to eat healthier and see if that helps. Pain is largely left breastbone and sternum, but it can move around sometimes. Hang in there!"
