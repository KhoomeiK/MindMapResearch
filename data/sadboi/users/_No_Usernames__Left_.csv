OCD,fhihggt,t1_fhhxkbb,1581624831.0,"Thank you for the advice and the kind words of support. Yeah, I was worried about the effect that resigning might have on my mind. But I was working from home, so this could be an opportunity to get out and about.

I will take that advice on board. I finished my last article yesterday, and my OCD wants me to go back and count something again. I’m trying to resist, but I’m already finding it hard to move on with my life and do things. My brain tells me I’ll have to redo everything that I’ve done since that article. I guess my OCD knows it’s my last article for the company and it’s latching onto that. Otherwise, it’ll be too hard to fix in the future.

I know anxiety levels rise whenever you expose yourself, but it’s hard to remind myself that I’ve had so many thoughts which I thought would bother me forever. The idea of being bothered by one tiny thing for years is overwhelming.

Sorry for venting! Haha. I really appreciate your help. I hope your life has improved."
OCD,fb3j8hh,t1_fb3grr8,1576475004.0,"We predict outcomes, but there’s no guarantee that our predictions will be correct.


I completely understand how you feel. I’ve been using logic to quieten my obsessive thoughts for a while, but new thoughts keep taking their place.  As a result, my OCD keeps escalating. Now, I’m dealing with magical thinking, and those thoughts can’t be proven or disproven.


Still, that’s helped me to understand OCD. It doesn’t care about logic; it just cares about imposing control on an uncertain world. For me, coming to that realisation was a wake-up call. Exposure seems to be the answer. I still have a long way to go, of course.


I hope you find a long-term solution. Searching for proof seems to keep making things more difficult for me. I think that’s what other people on this subreddit have said, too."
OCD,f7jd8bl,t3_dwdc4x,1573775174.0,"Are you me? I’m a musician, and I’m in a very similar situation. My album has been practically finished for a couple of months, and I’ve been struggling to distribute it, too. The fact that you only get one opportunity to submit a song for playlist consideration on Spotify has definitely made it hard for me to draw a line under it. I have 16 songs that I’m excited to show to the world, but I’ve still not distributed them.


I also have COCD, and I’ve been trying to work through that. Feeling guilty about doing ERP (not cleaning my phone/laptop excessively) has caused the thought that I can’t upload my music on a dirty laptop... I don’t understand that thought, but magical thinking is strange. I guess ERP just makes you feel guilty.


Anyway, good luck! We’ll do it at some point. I know how it feels to make continuous changes. I keep noticing clipping in songs, and that makes me want to update tracks (even if the clipping isn’t really audible). And I record vocals numerous times to get them perfect, but (without autotune) I suppose it doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to be in tune. We’ll always want to make improvements. We just have to be brave and get our music out there. I’m hoping I’ll manage to do it before the end of the year."
OCD,f70wd31,t1_f70qm22,1573333332.0,"Haha, I’m glad you understand, but I also wish you didn’t understand, obviously. It’s a real struggle. I hope you’re slowly getting better!


Don’t worry; we all give into compulsions! The key is to be kind to yourself and remember that recovery is always ongoing. For example, if I can upload my music (eventually) without cleaning my laptop and other tech, that’ll be great! But if I end up cleaning my devices before uploading my songs, I’ll still have exposed myself to my fear for a little while. And that’s ERP, in a way.


Every small step in the right direction is progress. I know it’s hard to remember that, though. Right now, my mind is saying: “Ahhhh, you’ll feel guilty forever and stop enjoying your songs if you upload them on a potentially-dirty device!” I really can’t wait to move past this thought. Contamination guilt is the worst... So many people barely ever wash their hands, but they’re still happy and healthy. I’m envious! Meanwhile, I’m worrying about potential contaminations that might not have happened, lol. Still, even if contaminations do happen, learning to not feel guilty is the way forwards.


Anyway, if you ever want to talk (seeing as we both have COCD and similar thoughts), then feel free to message me! 😄"
OCD,f70an1t,t3_dtsn93,1573326356.0,"I’m currently worrying about this, too. I usually shower immediately or shortly after a #2. Nearly 2 weeks ago, I went for a #2 earlier in the day and showered later. No big deal, right? Normal people take a #2 without showering afterwards... Of course, OCD makes me doubt this, but that’s typical of the disorder.


Anyway, I don’t remember if there was splash-back, but my OCD tells me there might have been. Later, I was putting on some jeans, before I went out, and my hand accidentally grazed the back of my upper thigh. Obviously, this made me feel like my hand had become dirty from my toilet trip and that dirtiness was now on my belt/jeans. I worried that I might have got germs on my phone in my pocket, as a result.


I managed to resist the urge to clean my phone when I got home later, and I spread the potential contamination to my laptop, charger, and so on. Of course, because I’ve been exposing myself by resisting that compulsion successfully, OCD has thrown other obsessive thoughts at me to lure me back in.


“You’re being irresponsible by not cleaning your devices; you could make yourself and your partner unwell by spreading germs.” Guilt trips are very intrusive, as we all know.


Also: “You can’t distribute your latest album on a dirty laptop.” I’m a musician. That’s magical thinking, obviously. And I’ve been able to do everyday things on my phone and laptop for the past 2 weeks, but uploading my music would be something that I’d *enjoy*. So, my OCD is making me feel as if I don’t deserve to do that until I’ve given in and performed the original compulsion to clean my devices.


I’m sorry for rambling. I just think it helps to show solidarity. It actually felt good to see somebody make this post because your fear has caused a particularly intrusive thought for me since last Monday, too. I understand."

ERPDiary,f6vbiww,t1_f6ut6r8,1573181629.0,"Well, I hate the feeling of nausea, but I suppose I’m specifically trying to avoid getting another stomach bug. Common colds don’t frighten me as much, but being properly sick for an extended period of time makes me feel powerless. So, I suppose I developed OCD to try to regain control. Obviously, as is often the case with COCD, I don’t want to develop *any* kind of health problem. Visiting the hospital or my local clinic can make me feel quite anxious because I’m aware that sick people might be around me.


That’s great! I hope to do the same. I’ve been avoiding using electronic wipes on my devices, so I’m hoping I’ll get over the need to have a clean phone and laptop.


Thanks for the advice. I’ve seen the recommendation to make a plan of action, and I suppose I have a rough plan. Maybe I need to set myself some clear goals. And I’m glad to read about somebody else dealing with ‘accidental’ exposures because they must still happen to people doing ERP therapy. I know it’s harder to prevent the response when an exposure takes you by surprise, obviously, but I assume we still have to try our best. Still, I understand why intentional exposures are supposed to help; it’s about progressing at your own rate. I’ve been doing well at avoiding some compulsions when unintentionally exposed to my fears, however, so I should feel encouraged by that.


That’s a great mentality to have. It’s about taking things day by day, after all. I do feel myself slowly improving. Obviously, I might experience some spikes in my anxiety when I pluck up the courage to expose myself to some of my biggest fears, but I think my mindset has become more positive. It definitely helps to keep researching and understanding this disorder.


I’ll try to post things if I take any noteworthy steps towards getting better, haha!"
ERPDiary,f6rgykj,t3_dgkupx,1573103668.0,"Hey, everyone!

Well, I think I started developing COCD in 2017. It’s hard to pinpoint the event which caused it to start, but I think it might have been a stomach bug/food poisoning in late 2016. Compulsive hand-washing spiralled out of control throughout 2018. I also got a new iPhone and started compulsively cleaning that, too. I didn’t want it to be dirty and make me unwell. As time went on, OCD narrowed down my safe zone to the point at which **all** surfaces were potentially dirty. I was only happy to either put my phone in my pocket or hold it in my hands. Obviously, I kept my laptop and chargers clean, too, as I would touch a lot of those things before/after using my phone. I just wanted my everyday items to be clean.


It’s late 2019, and I still have those compulsions. The main difference is that I *accept* I have a disorder and I’m willing to make a change. This year, to reduce hand-washing, I started avoiding potentially-dirty things/situations, but I’ve learnt that this is a compulsion, too. So, ERP is the way forwards.


The main thing that kicked me into action was the gradual development of other OCD types. I had a bad time in September. My OCD went beyond health concerns. I’m a musician, and I found myself repeatedly uploading, deleting, and re-uploading a song because I was worrying that I hadn’t done things perfectly. Obviously, this was a frightening and confusing experience. The logical side of my brain thought that I’d probably entered the information correctly. However, I still felt the urge to do everything all over again. I did this repeatedly, for hours at a time, and that’s when I realised this was probably a new form of OCD.


So, after doing a lot of research (it’s hard to not research obsessively with this disorder), I’ve realised that I’m prone to both magical thinking *and* contamination. Even writing that is scary, but I suppose this is a form of exposure. It wasn’t really *planned* exposure, of course, and that’s another annoying OCD thought. OCD has been using my research to make me worry. Because I’m so focused on ERP, I suppose it makes sense that it’s latched onto that. The whole point of ERP is do exposures intentionally (so you can control the time at which you expose yourself, the type of obsession you’re going to target, and so on), but unintentional exposures will still happen, obviously. You can plan to brush up against a dirty surface, but you’re still going to do it by accident from time to time.


The problem is that my brain says, “that was an unintentional exposure, so you shouldn’t prevent the standard response/compulsion.” And, currently, I’ve been using a phone and laptop for over a week, even after grazing my possibly-dirty upper leg with my hand (after going to the toilet) and feeling that I might have contaminated my phone by accident. So, that was an unintentional exposure, but I still faced my fear and spread the possible-contamination to my laptop and other surfaces. And I want to move forwards by uploading some music. Yet, in turn, my magical thinking is that I shouldn’t upload my new album with a dirty laptop. My OCD makes that decision feel bad. I guess I feel guilty for potentially making my devices and other things in the house dirty. So, I feel that I don’t deserve the happiness of uploading my music to the world yet. Of course, I’m pretty sure I should expose myself by just uploading the music with a potentially-dirty laptop and showing myself that it’s not a dangerous situation. It’s all about embracing uncertainty, after all. Still, my OCD brain replies, “no, this started with an **unintentional** exposure, so this isn’t proper ERP.” I’m pretty certain you should still avoid compulsions when exposures are unintentional, but OCD has made me doubt that.


So, that’s my story from 2016/2017 to the present day, lol. Sorry for venting. I probably needed to open up. Thank you for making this subreddit, by the way."
OCD,f6quh9g,t1_f6klxqx,1573086230.0,"Those were some good points. Thank you for the encouraging words, and I hope your treatment is going well! :)


I think I’ve just been obsessing about doing ERP correctly for the past week. It’s probably OCD’s way of getting me to avoid exposing myself to a particular fear. “This exposure was unintentional, and ERP involves *intentional* exposures. Therefore, you should respond as usual. You shouldn’t do therapy incorrectly.”


Still, even though this appears to be classic OCD, I’m struggling to accept that and power through.


As you say, I guess it’s all about taking things one day at a time. And you’re right - I want to spend more time doing things I love, too. That’s a good source of motivation. I’ve been delaying the release of my music, so it’ll be great when I finally manage to show it to the world."
OCD,f6oew1j,t3_ds78cw,1573015503.0,"I’m still trying to make progress with ERP for this aspect of my OCD. Well done for exposing yourself at all. I’m a musician, but I’ve yet to properly distribute my latest album online because of recent magical thinking. This disorder seems to focus on things we enjoy."
OCD,f6l2m9i,t3_drqsio,1572927147.0,"I’m the same. I care about the environment, so I wish I didn’t use so much soap and water. Of course, it’s important to remember that we have a disorder, and we can only strive to get better with every passing day. Be kind to yourself, and praise yourself for small steps in the right direction. Shortening the length of time it takes to wash your hands, for instance, could be a good start. Don’t worry; I’m still working on it, too."
OCD,f6kko6n,t1_f6kc5sg,1572914032.0,"Thank you for explaining ERP so clearly, and I’m grateful that you read *any* of it, haha. Yeah, I’ve read that it’s helpful to intentionally think “the worst thing might happen.” In some instances, I can do that. With COCD, I’ve made some progress. OCD just makes things difficult by choosing things which matter, as you probably know. Obviously, that’s why it’s trying to latch onto music which I spent months creating... And you’re right, it’s much harder to prevent responses or reactions when you’re unintentionally exposed to anxiety, so that’s also made it difficult to move forwards. I know I should upload my music to the internet without cleaning my phone/laptop first, but it’s so much harder to do ERP when it’s something so meaningful to you.


Anyway, the point is that you should avoid compulsions *whenever* you’re exposed, but starting with intentional exposures is supposed to make it easier to experience unintentional exposures?"
OCD,f6j1smw,t1_f6ixwwc,1572887834.0,"Thank you for your response. Yeah, I was quite sure that you should always avoid compulsions, so I think my OCD just latched onto the idea of *intentional* exposures to try to stop me. I think it was a guilt trip; I guess that’s just how my brain reacted to the RP. After all, I’ve already avoided compulsions with some unintentional exposures, and I felt better in the long run. Hopefully, I’ll have the courage to upload my music soon.


And you’re definitely right about telling yourself that it doesn’t matter rather than trying to find the answer. Sometimes, it’s just hard. Anyway, I hope things are going well for you."
