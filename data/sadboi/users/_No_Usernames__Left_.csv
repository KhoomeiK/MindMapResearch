OCD,fhihggt,t1_fhhxkbb,1581624831.0,"Thank you for the advice and the kind words of support. Yeah, I was worried about the effect that resigning might have on my mind. But I was working from home, so this could be an opportunity to get out and about.

I will take that advice on board. I finished my last article yesterday, and my OCD wants me to go back and count something again. I‚Äôm trying to resist, but I‚Äôm already finding it hard to move on with my life and do things. My brain tells me I‚Äôll have to redo everything that I‚Äôve done since that article. I guess my OCD knows it‚Äôs my last article for the company and it‚Äôs latching onto that. Otherwise, it‚Äôll be too hard to fix in the future.

I know anxiety levels rise whenever you expose yourself, but it‚Äôs hard to remind myself that I‚Äôve had so many thoughts which I thought would bother me forever. The idea of being bothered by one tiny thing for years is overwhelming.

Sorry for venting! Haha. I really appreciate your help. I hope your life has improved."
OCD,fb3j8hh,t1_fb3grr8,1576475004.0,"We predict outcomes, but there‚Äôs no guarantee that our predictions will be correct.


I completely understand how you feel. I‚Äôve been using logic to quieten my obsessive thoughts for a while, but new thoughts keep taking their place.  As a result, my OCD keeps escalating. Now, I‚Äôm dealing with magical thinking, and those thoughts can‚Äôt be proven or disproven.


Still, that‚Äôs helped me to understand OCD. It doesn‚Äôt care about logic; it just cares about imposing control on an uncertain world. For me, coming to that realisation was a wake-up call. Exposure seems to be the answer. I still have a long way to go, of course.


I hope you find a long-term solution. Searching for proof seems to keep making things more difficult for me. I think that‚Äôs what other people on this subreddit have said, too."
OCD,f7jd8bl,t3_dwdc4x,1573775174.0,"Are you me? I‚Äôm a musician, and I‚Äôm in a very similar situation. My album has been practically finished for a couple of months, and I‚Äôve been struggling to distribute it, too. The fact that you only get one opportunity to submit a song for playlist consideration on Spotify has definitely made it hard for me to draw a line under it. I have 16 songs that I‚Äôm excited to show to the world, but I‚Äôve still not distributed them.


I also have COCD, and I‚Äôve been trying to work through that. Feeling guilty about doing ERP (not cleaning my phone/laptop excessively) has caused the thought that I can‚Äôt upload my music on a dirty laptop... I don‚Äôt understand that thought, but magical thinking is strange. I guess ERP just makes you feel guilty.


Anyway, good luck! We‚Äôll do it at some point. I know how it feels to make continuous changes. I keep noticing clipping in songs, and that makes me want to update tracks (even if the clipping isn‚Äôt really audible). And I record vocals numerous times to get them perfect, but (without autotune) I suppose it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect. It just has to be in tune. We‚Äôll always want to make improvements. We just have to be brave and get our music out there. I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll manage to do it before the end of the year."
OCD,f70wd31,t1_f70qm22,1573333332.0,"Haha, I‚Äôm glad you understand, but I also wish you didn‚Äôt understand, obviously. It‚Äôs a real struggle. I hope you‚Äôre slowly getting better!


Don‚Äôt worry; we all give into compulsions! The key is to be kind to yourself and remember that recovery is always ongoing. For example, if I can upload my music (eventually) without cleaning my laptop and other tech, that‚Äôll be great! But if I end up cleaning my devices before uploading my songs, I‚Äôll still have exposed myself to my fear for a little while. And that‚Äôs ERP, in a way.


Every small step in the right direction is progress. I know it‚Äôs hard to remember that, though. Right now, my mind is saying: ‚ÄúAhhhh, you‚Äôll feel guilty forever and stop enjoying your songs if you upload them on a potentially-dirty device!‚Äù I really can‚Äôt wait to move past this thought. Contamination guilt is the worst... So many people barely ever wash their hands, but they‚Äôre still happy and healthy. I‚Äôm envious! Meanwhile, I‚Äôm worrying about potential contaminations that might not have happened, lol. Still, even if contaminations do happen, learning to not feel guilty is the way forwards.


Anyway, if you ever want to talk (seeing as we both have COCD and similar thoughts), then feel free to message me! üòÑ"
OCD,f70an1t,t3_dtsn93,1573326356.0,"I‚Äôm currently worrying about this, too. I usually shower immediately or shortly after a #2. Nearly 2 weeks ago, I went for a #2 earlier in the day and showered later. No big deal, right? Normal people take a #2 without showering afterwards... Of course, OCD makes me doubt this, but that‚Äôs typical of the disorder.


Anyway, I don‚Äôt remember if there was splash-back, but my OCD tells me there might have been. Later, I was putting on some jeans, before I went out, and my hand accidentally grazed the back of my upper thigh. Obviously, this made me feel like my hand had become dirty from my toilet trip and that dirtiness was now on my belt/jeans. I worried that I might have got germs on my phone in my pocket, as a result.


I managed to resist the urge to clean my phone when I got home later, and I spread the potential contamination to my laptop, charger, and so on. Of course, because I‚Äôve been exposing myself by resisting that compulsion successfully, OCD has thrown other obsessive thoughts at me to lure me back in.


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being irresponsible by not cleaning your devices; you could make yourself and your partner unwell by spreading germs.‚Äù Guilt trips are very intrusive, as we all know.


Also: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt distribute your latest album on a dirty laptop.‚Äù I‚Äôm a musician. That‚Äôs magical thinking, obviously. And I‚Äôve been able to do everyday things on my phone and laptop for the past 2 weeks, but uploading my music would be something that I‚Äôd *enjoy*. So, my OCD is making me feel as if I don‚Äôt deserve to do that until I‚Äôve given in and performed the original compulsion to clean my devices.


I‚Äôm sorry for rambling. I just think it helps to show solidarity. It actually felt good to see somebody make this post because your fear has caused a particularly intrusive thought for me since last Monday, too. I understand."

ERPDiary,f6vbiww,t1_f6ut6r8,1573181629.0,"Well, I hate the feeling of nausea, but I suppose I‚Äôm specifically trying to avoid getting another stomach bug. Common colds don‚Äôt frighten me as much, but being properly sick for an extended period of time makes me feel powerless. So, I suppose I developed OCD to try to regain control. Obviously, as is often the case with COCD, I don‚Äôt want to develop *any* kind of health problem. Visiting the hospital or my local clinic can make me feel quite anxious because I‚Äôm aware that sick people might be around me.


That‚Äôs great! I hope to do the same. I‚Äôve been avoiding using electronic wipes on my devices, so I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll get over the need to have a clean phone and laptop.


Thanks for the advice. I‚Äôve seen the recommendation to make a plan of action, and I suppose I have a rough plan. Maybe I need to set myself some clear goals. And I‚Äôm glad to read about somebody else dealing with ‚Äòaccidental‚Äô exposures because they must still happen to people doing ERP therapy. I know it‚Äôs harder to prevent the response when an exposure takes you by surprise, obviously, but I assume we still have to try our best. Still, I understand why intentional exposures are supposed to help; it‚Äôs about progressing at your own rate. I‚Äôve been doing well at avoiding some compulsions when unintentionally exposed to my fears, however, so I should feel encouraged by that.


That‚Äôs a great mentality to have. It‚Äôs about taking things day by day, after all. I do feel myself slowly improving. Obviously, I might experience some spikes in my anxiety when I pluck up the courage to expose myself to some of my biggest fears, but I think my mindset has become more positive. It definitely helps to keep researching and understanding this disorder.


I‚Äôll try to post things if I take any noteworthy steps towards getting better, haha!"
ERPDiary,f6rgykj,t3_dgkupx,1573103668.0,"Hey, everyone!

Well, I think I started developing COCD in 2017. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint the event which caused it to start, but I think it might have been a stomach bug/food poisoning in late 2016. Compulsive hand-washing spiralled out of control throughout 2018. I also got a new iPhone and started compulsively cleaning that, too. I didn‚Äôt want it to be dirty and make me unwell. As time went on, OCD narrowed down my safe zone to the point at which **all** surfaces were potentially dirty. I was only happy to either put my phone in my pocket or hold it in my hands. Obviously, I kept my laptop and chargers clean, too, as I would touch a lot of those things before/after using my phone. I just wanted my everyday items to be clean.


It‚Äôs late 2019, and I still have those compulsions. The main difference is that I *accept* I have a disorder and I‚Äôm willing to make a change. This year, to reduce hand-washing, I started avoiding potentially-dirty things/situations, but I‚Äôve learnt that this is a compulsion, too. So, ERP is the way forwards.


The main thing that kicked me into action was the gradual development of other OCD types. I had a bad time in September. My OCD went beyond health concerns. I‚Äôm a musician, and I found myself repeatedly uploading, deleting, and re-uploading a song because I was worrying that I hadn‚Äôt done things perfectly. Obviously, this was a frightening and confusing experience. The logical side of my brain thought that I‚Äôd probably entered the information correctly. However, I still felt the urge to do everything all over again. I did this repeatedly, for hours at a time, and that‚Äôs when I realised this was probably a new form of OCD.


So, after doing a lot of research (it‚Äôs hard to not research obsessively with this disorder), I‚Äôve realised that I‚Äôm prone to both magical thinking *and* contamination. Even writing that is scary, but I suppose this is a form of exposure. It wasn‚Äôt really *planned* exposure, of course, and that‚Äôs another annoying OCD thought. OCD has been using my research to make me worry. Because I‚Äôm so focused on ERP, I suppose it makes sense that it‚Äôs latched onto that. The whole point of ERP is do exposures intentionally (so you can control the time at which you expose yourself, the type of obsession you‚Äôre going to target, and so on), but unintentional exposures will still happen, obviously. You can plan to brush up against a dirty surface, but you‚Äôre still going to do it by accident from time to time.


The problem is that my brain says, ‚Äúthat was an unintentional exposure, so you shouldn‚Äôt prevent the standard response/compulsion.‚Äù And, currently, I‚Äôve been using a phone and laptop for over a week, even after grazing my possibly-dirty upper leg with my hand (after going to the toilet) and feeling that I might have contaminated my phone by accident. So, that was an unintentional exposure, but I still faced my fear and spread the possible-contamination to my laptop and other surfaces. And I want to move forwards by uploading some music. Yet, in turn, my magical thinking is that I shouldn‚Äôt upload my new album with a dirty laptop. My OCD makes that decision feel bad. I guess I feel guilty for potentially making my devices and other things in the house dirty. So, I feel that I don‚Äôt deserve the happiness of uploading my music to the world yet. Of course, I‚Äôm pretty sure I should expose myself by just uploading the music with a potentially-dirty laptop and showing myself that it‚Äôs not a dangerous situation. It‚Äôs all about embracing uncertainty, after all. Still, my OCD brain replies, ‚Äúno, this started with an **unintentional** exposure, so this isn‚Äôt proper ERP.‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty certain you should still avoid compulsions when exposures are unintentional, but OCD has made me doubt that.


So, that‚Äôs my story from 2016/2017 to the present day, lol. Sorry for venting. I probably needed to open up. Thank you for making this subreddit, by the way."
OCD,f6quh9g,t1_f6klxqx,1573086230.0,"Those were some good points. Thank you for the encouraging words, and I hope your treatment is going well! :)


I think I‚Äôve just been obsessing about doing ERP correctly for the past week. It‚Äôs probably OCD‚Äôs way of getting me to avoid exposing myself to a particular fear. ‚ÄúThis exposure was unintentional, and ERP involves *intentional* exposures. Therefore, you should respond as usual. You shouldn‚Äôt do therapy incorrectly.‚Äù


Still, even though this appears to be classic OCD, I‚Äôm struggling to accept that and power through.


As you say, I guess it‚Äôs all about taking things one day at a time. And you‚Äôre right - I want to spend more time doing things I love, too. That‚Äôs a good source of motivation. I‚Äôve been delaying the release of my music, so it‚Äôll be great when I finally manage to show it to the world."
OCD,f6oew1j,t3_ds78cw,1573015503.0,"I‚Äôm still trying to make progress with ERP for this aspect of my OCD. Well done for exposing yourself at all. I‚Äôm a musician, but I‚Äôve yet to properly distribute my latest album online because of recent magical thinking. This disorder seems to focus on things we enjoy."
OCD,f6l2m9i,t3_drqsio,1572927147.0,"I‚Äôm the same. I care about the environment, so I wish I didn‚Äôt use so much soap and water. Of course, it‚Äôs important to remember that we have a disorder, and we can only strive to get better with every passing day. Be kind to yourself, and praise yourself for small steps in the right direction. Shortening the length of time it takes to wash your hands, for instance, could be a good start. Don‚Äôt worry; I‚Äôm still working on it, too."
OCD,f6kko6n,t1_f6kc5sg,1572914032.0,"Thank you for explaining ERP so clearly, and I‚Äôm grateful that you read *any* of it, haha. Yeah, I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs helpful to intentionally think ‚Äúthe worst thing might happen.‚Äù In some instances, I can do that. With COCD, I‚Äôve made some progress. OCD just makes things difficult by choosing things which matter, as you probably know. Obviously, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs trying to latch onto music which I spent months creating... And you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs much harder to prevent responses or reactions when you‚Äôre unintentionally exposed to anxiety, so that‚Äôs also made it difficult to move forwards. I know I should upload my music to the internet without cleaning my phone/laptop first, but it‚Äôs so much harder to do ERP when it‚Äôs something so meaningful to you.


Anyway, the point is that you should avoid compulsions *whenever* you‚Äôre exposed, but starting with intentional exposures is supposed to make it easier to experience unintentional exposures?"
OCD,f6j1smw,t1_f6ixwwc,1572887834.0,"Thank you for your response. Yeah, I was quite sure that you should always avoid compulsions, so I think my OCD just latched onto the idea of *intentional* exposures to try to stop me. I think it was a guilt trip; I guess that‚Äôs just how my brain reacted to the RP. After all, I‚Äôve already avoided compulsions with some unintentional exposures, and I felt better in the long run. Hopefully, I‚Äôll have the courage to upload my music soon.


And you‚Äôre definitely right about telling yourself that it doesn‚Äôt matter rather than trying to find the answer. Sometimes, it‚Äôs just hard. Anyway, I hope things are going well for you."
