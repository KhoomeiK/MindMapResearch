M1A1Death,emr95v,top_level,"He was my absolute inspiration in school. I'm an Aerospace Engineering student and my program requires all B's and a 3.2 GPA. I can't even imagine myself practicing math or physics. I start school on Monday and I can't even see myself caring or being able to concentrate. If I miss this semester, I have to wait until next spring because of how the courses line up.  
  
I'm in charge of his estate as well. And I work. I went back to work for the first time yesterday, and ended up leaving early.  
  
What do I do"
Laurasaur28,fdqvazi,t3_emr95v,"We are all so sorry to hear this. Please contact your academic advisor and consider taking a compassionate withdrawal for a term or however long you need. If you don’t end up withdrawing you should avail yourself of all the academic and mental health resources your school offers. 

Best wishes to you, whatever you decide to do. ❤️"
mechE_or_bust,fdqft64,t3_emr95v,"Take the year off and focus on healing and making money from work. No use in paying for school if you're not able to commit to it. There's no shame in taking some time off, especially since you'll have things to keep you busy. Just don't fall into a cycle of doing nothing and sulking, keep yourself as busy as you can while actively recovering and healing. Best of luck."
wade678,fdqt1qr,t1_fdqft64,"I second this. I did this myself for mental health reasons and it was the best decision I could have made. Take the time you need to recover and go back when you’re ready. School will always be there. Luckily most schools are just now starting or have not started yet. If it’s too late, speak with the counseling department about starting a medical withdraw. They will understand and it will expunge all grades from this semester. It will be like you were never there. Best of luck to you OP."
M1A1Death,fdroi40,t1_fdqft64,I'm using the GI Bill so idk how that will work. I already submitted for benefits for this semester so idk if it's too late to stop them.
Reganato,fdrjoos,t1_fdqft64,"This absolutely OP.  You've gone through something absolutely devestating.  Life is long, you have plenty of time to complete your degree, there is no sense in trying to manage a demanding program, your father's estate, your feelings, and the rest of your life right now.  It's too much, and nobody is going to give you a hard time for taking time off to take care of yourself.  Nobody that isn't a shit head anyway."
walkingshadows,fdrr401,t1_fdroi40,It's not. The VA won't even pay your tuition out until a few weeks into the semester. At least that's how it works at both schools I'm attending. I suggest talking to your VA office to be completely sure but all you likely have to do is drop your classes and maybe pay back your book stipend if they paid it out already.
livingstone97,fds17uv,t1_fdroi40,"I am also using the GI Bill and I don't think it would be too late to stop the benefits. Especially since you wouldn't get paid for this month until, at the soonest, the beginning of next month. 

Plus, you have the ability to change your schedule at literally any moment and that paperwork has to be submitted to the VA office to be processed. 

Either way, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Please talk to a professional if you can, and please surround yourself with loved ones during this time. If you decide to go to school, talk to your advisor and the mental health people at your school, and also tell your professors about what is going on. Take care of yourself. There is no shame in needing to take this semester off."
M1A1Death,fdron7i,t1_fdrjoos,"My whole family is saying things like ""your father wouldn't want you to stop school because of this"" and it makes me feel bad in a way because I know it's absolutely true. He was a great guy and I always pushed myself to impress him."
emf729,fdrt05r,t1_fdron7i,"Grieving isn't for the dead, it's for the living. If you don't let yourself heal and deal with the aftermath, you will surely find yourself struggling even more and it may have an impact on your performance (personally, professionally, and academically) that has further consequences. 

Edited to add: To clarify, I mean that the time after you lose someone and the grieving process is about *you* finding a new normal, not just honoring the person you've lost. Find your footing on your terms, not based on what your family is telling you or he would tell you."
britirb,fdrru7q,t1_fdron7i,"You're not stopping, though? Analogy: you're taking the time to untangle your emotional headphones so you can use them for years. Versus just tugging them tight and dealing with the knot until the cables inside snap and you have to research new headphones then drive to the store and buy them. So now you have to figure out how to get used to these new headphones when the ones you had before would have lasted another ten years if you'd just taken care of them.

&#x200B;

>He was a great guy and I always pushed myself to impress him.

From the way you're pushing back against the (very reasonable and grounded in experience) advice everybody is giving you, I feel like you think taking a sabbatical is the easy way out. Have you considered you might want to stay in school and keep trucking *because that is the easier solution?* It's familiar, you don't have to process everything that's happening because you'll be able to distract yourself. Dealing with emotions is HARD and you have to choose grappling with schoolwork or yourself, right now. You can't do both.

&#x200B;

On a personal note, I did the whole ""almost destroy myself trying to impress my dad"" bit. Now that I'm on the other side, he has said that he wishes I had given fewer shits about his opinion. I wish I had, too.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

> My whole family is saying things like ""your father wouldn't want you to stop school because of this"" and it makes me feel bad 

Fuck your family, dude. Straight up. I don't care if they think they're helping, you don't say something like that to somebody who has just lost their father. If they think saying that will help you, that just shows how effed their view is."
livingstone97,fds2gay,t1_fdron7i,"But I am also sure your father would want you do take care of yourself and take care of your own health. He loved you and he wouldn't want you to suffer and put yourself through hell trying to do something that you couldn't handle at the moment. 


Taking a break from school is not quitting/stopping school. I have friends who had to take time off due to poor physical health, but they got back up on their feet and started going back to school, and they were even more successful than they would have been if they tried pushing themselves to go to school when their health simply wouldn't allow it. 

There is no shame in taking time off if that's what your health and grades require. You just need to do what is best for you and your health. Please don't let others make you feel guilty for taking care of yourself and mourning in your own way."
SkiMonkey98,fdt7ole,t1_fdron7i,"> My whole family is saying things like ""your father wouldn't want you to stop school because of this""

He wouldn't want you to drop out. I obviously didn't know him, but I'd like to think he could respect you taking a set amount of time off to handle his estate and your own grieving, before going back to do your best work"
1Wittgenstein1,fdugucu,t1_fdron7i,"Your father would surely have wanted you to finish school. A semester or a year out is nothing in the grand scheme of things. Retire one year later. 

From my own experience, even if you can manage now, there will be a time in the next while when you will feel completely exhausted. Toughing it out now is not necessarily the wisest choice. 

That said, maybe you need something to keep you occupied. Maybe you can take just one course this semester? Maybe you can at least take an elective?"
babycashew,fdwsq2p,t1_fdron7i,"Sometimes you just need a break and you need to take care of yourself. Just as long as you don’t give up and you do eventually return back to your program. 

Your dad will be proud of you no matter what, and I’m sure he’d want you to put yourself first. A year isn’t going to make or break things, you can slow down and work on rebuilding yourself."
M1A1Death,fdrt8hk,t1_fdrru7q,"Another issue I find myself is finances. The GI Bill pays most of my bills. Without school, I can't pay rent. I have a job but it's on campus work and I'm limited to 20 hours per week at just above minimum wage. I want to not go to school but i worry about this sort of stuff too. :/"
Roccia19,fdqg1at,t3_emr95v,"I'm very sorry for your loss. You need time to grieve and work through the aftermath. Please seek out help through this hard time.

As for school, no one will blame you if you take a semester off or step back your class load. On one hand it is good to keep busy, but you also need to recognize that it will be some time before your back to the right place. Having all free time is likely not a good option either, need to find a balance."
M1A1Death,fdroq65,t1_fdqg1at,I was scheduled for 18 credits but I dropped down to 13. I can't drop anymore due to utilizing the GI Bill unfortunately.
hitman4636,fdtzn2u,t1_fdroq65,"If you're capable of studying everything from books and internet, one thing you can do is try talking to your professors. I believe most of them will let you off the regular classes and you can just attend important dates. Good luck!"
Sugarforthepill_,fdqtz9z,t3_emr95v,"The worst thing you can do is go to school in a bad mental state, get shit grades while paying money and dig yourself a GPA hole.

If going to school works for you and will help, do it. If, like you said, you don’t feel like you’re in a position to focus on classes, take the semester off. For real, it’s not a big deal to take time off. Get the estate in order, take time to grieve; maybe go on an extended trip if you can (would highly encourage) or try new hobbies. 

I’m sorry for your loss and I hope the best for you.

Edit: also, therapy."
groggydog,fdqt6uh,t3_emr95v,"As others have said, contact your academic advising office and inquire about a medically reduced course load or a full medical leave of absence. Focus on taking care of yourself right now; school will be there when you get back!"
M1A1Death,fdrpo54,t1_fdqt6uh,Would this constitute a full time load? I need to manage full time in order to satisfy my GI Bill. I can't pay my bills wihout the housing allowance it provides
groggydog,fdrt2k5,t1_fdrpo54,"There may be dispensations for medical (ie mental health related in this case) leaves - I work with international students and see this a lot. Ask! It’s entirely possible, but it’s a big “it depends”."
AceyAceyAcey,fdqixd2,t3_emr95v,"I highly encourage you to seek out counseling. If you do go back to school, they have free confidential counseling services. You can start the semester, get free counseling, and if you can’t complete you can get a medical withdrawal that shouldn’t affect your GPA. 

You can also call a suicide hotline for support right now. Many such hotlines (including the one linked below) explicitly say they’re there to help support survivors who’ve lost a loved one to suicide.

Cewells14,fdqu1kr,t3_emr95v,"I think you should strongly consider taking the year off. You could try a reduced course load, and definitely look into that, but if you take a year to work while maybe visiting a therapist, you could potentially be a lot more motivated by the time next spring rolls around. You have to keep busy, though. Take some time right now to grieve, and don't rush into work or school if you can avoid it. Then when you're ready make sure you fill your schedule with some positive things to do. I'm very sorry for your loss. :("
eggblossom,fdr2wcv,t3_emr95v,Please do not go to class in any sort of unmotivated or sad mental state. You will destroy your GPA and future. Speaking from experience.

Rest, eat well, request support."
peregrin5,fdqybnd,t3_emr95v,"If you need time, take the time, even if the classes aren't offered until next Spring. It's better to take the time to grieve and heal than to try to jump right into it when you aren't ready and just let your grades drop down the hole. 

If you feel better by next term or summer term, try taking other classes that are required for your program at this time. Also look into other colleges nearby that might offer the classes you need a bit earlier. Some schools will allow you take individual classes from other schools and transfer the credits. 

I'm sorry for your loss."

xRazersharpx,fdqyyoa,t3_emr95v,"So my father passed away 2 years ago, I am very sorry for your lose. I'm not exactly sure how you are feeling or how your father was but I used it as an opportunity to think of what my dad would want to see his son do (or daughter) kept my head up and pushed forward. It doesn't get any easier to think of your father as time goes on maybe talk about but never think of him. It's been 2 years now but still feels like yesterday it happened. Take your time, everything might be moving at a hundred miles an hour but press the brakes a bit and don't be too quick on decisions. Good luck I wish you the best."
evilwoman747,fdr03mt,t3_emr95v,"Grief is real, and there is no real, concrete way to handle it. If you take the year off it may be enough time for you to move through the stages. My father was terminally ill, but it still felt sudden when he passed away the day after my junior year. I feel like although I went back to school a week later, the rest of that year was a blurr of not caring. I cant imagine even what you're going through. I hope you have a good support system, and that you take care of yourself."
TatePeters,fdr12z9,t3_emr95v,"This is in no way similar to what you are going through- but a month before I started college my mom passed away from cancer. I committed to the school year but I really shouldnt have. I should have taken a year off to process, grieve, and pull myself together. 

My biggest advice is to take a semester or two off and figure things out. You are going through an extremely difficult situation and I admire your courage and strength. But please take the time to think about your own wellbeing and what is best for you! I am so sorry for your loss, if you need any help I'm here!"
ally-x,fdrbcat,t3_emr95v,"I lost my dad when I was 13- I’m 17 now. I know your world feels like it just blew up and everyone is trying to comfort you, but it’s not going to help. Losing a parent is so traumatic to your life it is going to take awhile to find your new normal. As regards to school, If you think being really busy is going to help you then i think you should do it. I know a lot of people that needed to grieve passively by working hard and not having time to think about it. I took off time from school, but then again I was in middle school at the time- but all it’s really doing is allowing you time to cry all day. After losing someone so important in your life, nothing else seems important- like school. I think taking a term off isn’t a bad idea but at the same time is it really going to help you?Your father loved you. It will be okay, just not right now. Keep your head up:)"
yUmmmmmie,fdsah44,t3_emr95v,"Wow. This is a hard one. First off, I'm sorry to hear this happened and to happen on Christmas. Your feelings right now are 100% valid. 

Your situation is really the reason deferment exists. One year is 12 months. 12 months to grieve, handle the estate, and heal.... a lot of stuff. You deserve to heal. So 12 months is a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. It's okay to do this. Your not letting anyone down and it's not going anywhere as long as you follow school policy. 

Imagine not deferring, not doing well, being over worked and stressed, depression sets in.. things get worse... and now your GPA is permanently damaged. Its not worth it. 

I say allow yourself to grieve and heal, school can wait. Just tell them and communicate with them and follow their deferment policy.

Edit: I just saw your on GI bill. Thank you for your service."

If you decide to continue with school this semester, I would say it’s best to take a light load and use your campus’s mental health services as needed. I think you should put yourself first in this situation and don’t try to put too much pressure on yourself and continue your education when you see fit. Again, I’m very sorry for your loss."

Cry all you want, the real world can wait but after you've done all the crying make sure you make peace with the past and get your ass in the game again with new hope. I'm so sorry man.

temsik1587againtwo,fdr63ax,t3_emr95v,"Sorry to hear, that must be hard.

Do whatever is best for your mental well-being. Even if you finish faster, it will be worse for you if you put work in front of yourself. In order to do well, you need to be well. If you need some time away, take some time off and learn how to cope with this loss."
MithrilYakuza,fdr6hot,t3_emr95v,"As others have said, you need to practice some really aggressive self-compassion in the moment. Future-you will really appreciate it. Just accept that you will remember the next year of your life as an awful haze. That's perfectly normal. 

You need to be tapping any and all resources for support, not trying to scrape the bottom of your own barrel. 

Suicide carries its own separate issues. My first ever BF committed suicide. You need a support group, people who have been there. Check out NAMI, I think they have a list of local groups, it's a place to start. Talk to your school about counseling. Even if you don't talk about your dad in therapy, avoiding isolating yourself is important. 

Talk to school admin, they will understand. One year is nothing. Maybe you can get some electives out of the way freeing up time later for an internship or something. You'll figure it out, it'll work. 

Feel free to PM if you need someone to talk to/vent at, I've seen a few friends go through this."

At the time, I had to handle all kinds of things, and couldn't really process anything. It was literally years before I began to truly process my grief and come to terms with what had happened. Don't hold yourself to impossible standards right now just because you feel like you're still capable. Let yourself *be* a little incapable and let your grieving process get underway properly.

keithkos1,fdrpkkj,t3_emr95v,"Hard hard hard...

First, you might figure out a support team.  

Ie write on a piece of paper 5 people that want to see you do well and too can understand parts of your experiences, for support.  

Eg a sibling, a friend, therapist, a mentor at a grief or suicide support group, college support services person, etc

From there, i would seek clear thoughtful clean counsel and support, before You decide the next steps right for you. There are pros and cons to all decisions...

Foodandskates,fdrx8ra,t3_emr95v,"First step is talk to an advisor. There are usually more resources than students know about, and some of these can only be accessible via staff member referral or professor referral. This is what we do at my campus. Find out the resources for mental health, too. Some schools can refer you to community mental health clinics that might be more accessible if your campus mental health servies are limited.

If you really don't think you can handle your major classes, but taking a break is not an issue due to finances, you may have options. Take General Education/Elective classes if you need these to complete your degree. Take classes for Credit/No credit (these do not affect GPA). Find out your school's grade forgiveness policy. I have seen students fail a few classes a semester an then utilize grade forgiveness the next semester to their advantage. It is not ideal, and I do not recommend this since it may take a heavier toll mentally but find out your options.

Only your advisors/professors can help you navigate these options. Also, talk to your financial aid office to see what aid you are eligible for if you drop to part time."

Me trying to push my emotions to the side  has done more harm to my academic career and performance than before my father passed. 

Please as someone who made several major mistakes and who only had others who told them to push away their feeling to focus on school and other matters I am begging you.

vodkalemin,fdsb8ls,t3_emr95v,"Sorry to hear about your father. I’m very close with mine, and I can imagine how much it would affect mine. A lot of people are saying to withdraw from school, but I would offer different advice. I would recommend completing full time, but taking a break from work as the GI bill will cover your bah. If you have a cheap enough place to live, you should be able to squeeze by without working. If anything, maybe take a small student loan to cover your expenses for this semester. I know engineering is difficult and time consuming, but that might be just what you need during this time of grieving. Without work you can focus on your studying and reflection. 

You won’t be set behind, and a break in school can be difficult to pick back up, I’d imagine a full year behind would make it even more so. If your worried about a gap in employment or giving up an “in” with an engineering firm, it would be easily explained away when you tell them your situation.

TLDR; Finish school, lighten your load if you need to, quit job, use extra time for healing."
her0nduck,fdsrrad,t3_emr95v,"Though my financial situation was a bit different, my dad very suddenly had a heart attack and dropped dead two weeks into semester two years ago this month. He was a statistician, completely brilliant, and his belief in me is definitely at the top of my list of reasons for going for a PhD after I graduate this spring. It seems completely overwhelming and impossible right now, I know. I KNOW. 

But if I had left that semester, I honestly don’t think I would have had it in me to go back. I’m sure this will piss a lot of people off, especially those who advocate for mental health first, but for people who have to work and have to go to school to survive financially, you can get through it. I was completely numb the whole semester. The only way I made it through was through a very strict schedule. I woke up and went to bed at the same time every day, ate pretty much the same thing everyday, went directly to class, then work, then study, then collapse and do it again. The days started to blur together and about halfway through, I was actually functional. I made extensive daily checklists, and that was my life (as in, I made a checkbox for EVERYTHING from deodorant to eating 3x day). 

You will get through it. You will make it. I did it. It sucked. But I made it. I also went to grief counseling once a week and gave myself one night a week to watch trash tv. Limit your emotional extremes as much as you can. 

Good luck this semester. My heart goes out to you."

Mikaela963,fdtsdi1,t3_emr95v,I am so sorry. Honestly all I can say is immediately get into therapy to help work through everything. If you feel as though a break might be best then maybe hold off for a semester and then see how you feel after some therapy and time away.
sammigrzanich,fdtt51w,t3_emr95v,"I am so so so sorry to hear you’re going through this. I couldn’t even imagine what you’re going through right now. I know it is so hard and scary right now and you might be mad at God or not understand why something like this would happen, but God brings all things together for your good. It may not be the timing you expect, but things will get better. You’re in my prayers"
klassykitty,fdtw7h2,t3_emr95v,"You're in a tough spot. It's okay to take a step back, take you're time and go back when you're ready. Good luck and sorry for your loss."
SuperiorT,fdub2de,t3_emr95v,"I hope you're doing ok, I too lost my father (not of suicide) and this was a few months after graduating high school. Take care."
Ryugi,fduj0no,t3_emr95v,"You can either give yourself a break and let yourself have emotional energy to learn to cope with the tragedy, or you can fight (keep doing it all, use it as proof that you are strong).

I believe in you. Personally I don't think you should quit your classes. Tell your professors what has happened and just politely request their understanding if you need extra time with homework or leeway with in-class exercises. Get therapy. Keep working. Remind yourself that you are strong and he'd be happy to see you doing your best."
Vince-15,fduj542,t3_emr95v,"First of all, I can't even imagine how difficult that would be. Second, look for help as you see fit, nothing about needing help or seeking out counselling is shameful whatsoever. Please help yourself and do what you know you need to in order to get through the next few years. I'm so sorry to hear about your dad, best wishes to you and your family!"
Parapurp,fdujgkq,t3_emr95v,"I think it is best for you to take at least this semester off to process what happened & eventually recover from this. There’s nothing wrong with graduating late, and you need that time for yourself right now. 
If you experience difficulty getting in a healthy mental space to do well in your courses at any point after this, look into a retroactive withdrawal due to the passing of a loved one. 
You will heal one day. Please allow yourself some time."
OnConch,fdv9zry,t3_emr95v,"First, I’m so sorry about your loss. My heart is bleeding for you right now, and while there’s so much I wanna say, I know nothing can embody this. This is the emotional equivalent of having your sternum shattered and heart carved out. My thoughts are with you and your family. 

Let me just... share some wisdom... 

My mom died from cancer at the start of my senior year of college, and several years later, I still regret muscling through it because ‘that’s what she would have wanted.’ It prolonged the healing, ingrained unhealthy workaholic tendencies, and unfortunately, aided in the facilitation of toxic romantic relationships. Yes, I’ve been in therapy since, and yes, my therapist and I have been able to narrow down my mishandled grief as one of the root causes for all of those things. Had I acknowledged the severity of my loss, taken a semester to regroup, and been compassionate to my healing, then my entire life would be very different right now. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that grief like this can hit the pause on your entire life. You’ll see the cautionary tales on grief forums for young people who have lost their parents. Something about this particular death in your early twenties stunts growth, and it’s not as obvious as you might think. Because I had read about people waking up one day and realizing they hadn’t moved on, I thought I was in the clear. I was being mindful about it, right? No.

I’m now in my late-twenties, and while I worked small freelance gigs and retail up until now, I just entered my actual field, just put my name on a lease, just stopped being flighty and immature in my relationships, and just started to worry about things like retirement, marriage, and even debt. I avoided growing up because growing up subconsciously meant saying goodbye to my mom, and again, I believe that longterm avoidance was due to not taking care of myself. Paying the bills doesn’t mean you’ve moved on. No longer sobbing because you can’t wrap your head around the fact Mom or Dad isn’t coming home doesn’t mean you’ve properly healed, and look, grief isn’t linear, and I still cry for my mom five years later, but it’s easy to trick yourself into thinking you’re fine.

What I’m saying to you is what I would say to my younger self. Be kind to yourself. Grief is for the living, not the dead. Your dad wouldn’t be upset or disappointed if you put less than six months of your life on hold so that the 60+ years you have left on this planet are good ones. School isn’t going anywhere, but this window of self-care is fundamental to how you’ll treat life. I promise.

Good luck. You have all of my condolences and hope. If you do stay in school, then utilize every mental health resource on campus (letting your professors know is a great start even if it might seem like oversharing — it saved my ass) and be kind to yourself when you hit those days that are overcome by sadness, rage, and so on."
Tessie1966,fdwpni0,t3_emr95v,My heart broke reading this. My advice is to go to the school counselor and tell them what is going on. They will be able to guide you and give you options. I know it will put you behind if you drop out and wait until next year but it is a better option than failing and having that on your school record. I am so sorry for your loss.
rothsteini,fdws9vi,t3_emr95v,"I am so so sorry for your loss. 

I literally signed up for reddit just now to encourage you to take the year off.

Life is long, and while there is something to be said about ""soldiering on"", your classes are going to demand a lot of you. Dealing with these classes while at the same time processing difficult emotions is a recipe for a really bad semester. 

As for living expenses, you may want to consider part-time work. If these things are available, they do not pay great, but enough to eke out an existence for the year.

Best of luck to you."
Flagstaff10,fdxkb42,t3_emr95v,"I am sooooo sorry to hear this news. My father passed away 2 weeks into my semester. My advisor suggested I withdraw for the semester. Long story short, I was too stubborn and it didnt give me the time I needed to process his death fully. Coming from a similar experience I really think you take the time to process your father's passing. School will be there when you are ready. Everything will be okay in the end, but I am sure life is hard right now, dont be afraid to take the time and help you need, losing a parent you are ao close with is tragic."

jhkhjh,fe43y5t,t3_emr95v,"\#1. I am very sad to hear about your father. I and MANY others will pray for you and your family.

\#2. PLEASE see a minister, a priest, rabbi or whatever religion you relate to. It is vital you understand God LOVES you and that you have a wonderful life ahead of you. You need to realize that just because things are not perfect life is a blessing and things always become brighter. JUst like the weather.

\#3. Consult for free with a couple of ""Wills and Estate"" lawyers. AND make sure up front the consultation is free. Then hire the lawyer you feel best about and get a REASONABLE FLAT rate to help you handle it. Do NOT pay by the hour.

\#4. Pray about you situation and make a decision if you want to take this semester off.  And whatever you decide be on touch with he administration of your school. They will be VERY UNDERSTANDING! They are there to help you!.

YOU HAVE A GREAT LIFE AHEAD. STAY POSITIVE!"

anishpatel131,fe8u0r8,t3_emr95v,Stop working and focus on school. The people telling you to work and not focus on school are short term thinkers. Think long term not making min wage job during college. If you quit college now to work the odds of you getting a degree plummet considerably. Don't take advice from those people
M1A1Death,fe8uw3e,t1_fe8u0r8,Well I do make about double minimum wage part time but I have to work some to pay my bills. I'm 27 and have been independent since 18. I am going to be doing school though as well. We'll see how it goes

M1A1Death,feb4tg9,t1_feb26qs,"I didn't inherit it. I simply was put in charge of managing the little things he had. I have to pay for his funeral too. I was extremely minimal in planning it so it will be about 4000, dollars. His estate will most like be considered insoluble"
Robinbird112,feb48cs,t3_emr95v,"Hi, my mother committed suicide my first day of college years ago.  I stayed in school because it was the best thing for me at the time.  I took lighter classes and didn't do my math or sciences.  It took several years for me to get back to ""normal"" and during that time I grieved very deeply. You have a lot on your plate and something has got to give.  Only you can figure out what stays and what goes, but remember, you come first.  Doing everything will not help you grieve or be successful.

You could take a leave of absence from your school.  The GI Bill might help you through this, but you have to ask.  You never know what support you have until you ask for it. Check with your counseling center and get help.  That is why they are there!

Good luck to you.  It's a hard road, but you WILL get through it. It's your turn to ask for help."

elisabethocean,fdqqc8g,t3_emr95v,Use the resources your school provides and think about going to a therapist if you can afford one. You definitely needs some time to stop and process this. Schools usually provide mental Heath services so look into that.
StuartLiddle,fdqr9r6,t3_emr95v,"Check out CAPS at your school, they usually offer a few one-on-one sessions, and might also offer group therapy which was incredibly helpful for me when working through a similar situation. Trauma affects everyone differently and let yourself grieve at your own pace. It’s crippling in the beginning, but as time passes you learn to live with the loss. It’s okay to not be okay all the time."

Yea, i’ll be honest. this has more to do with your lack of time management skills and less about life in general. Work is 40hrs a week or school. Learn how to study effectively, manage your time, and you’ll suddenly have more time to do all the fun things you want to."

Relrik,fe6mcvv,t1_fe2d4d5,"Well first of all you need to know what you want from life and start building towards that. 
For now just finish your college so you can get a good stable high paying job. 

Now after that is the question. Many people would just saddle themself with the next big responsibility and life drain, such as having kids. If building a family and raising kids is your goal and your happiness then go ahead. But if you just want to live your life doing whatever then making kids and or getting tied down to your current location due to relationships may not be good decisions for that particular goal. If you really wanted to you could work 40 hours and live your life with the other 30-40 hours a week. Pick your path and build towards it.

Life after high school doesn't have to be the generic suffocating depressing life you are thinking of. Your life will be built on the decisions you make. How you manage finances, how you plan ahead, how long you let your debt go unpaid, which jobs you choose and for how long you choose to stay at them. Which people you associate with. etc"

Relrik,fe6mm4s,t1_fe41ili,Well that could be possible. I'm just thinking work + college together are such a massive time and money drain that one may not have the resources to fully commit to such experiences. Maybe one just wants to unwind and chill in the little off time. Depends on the person.

Punchee,fe50g0l,t1_fe09cu5,"It's less this, the ratio thing, than the brain's experiencing of and processing ""novelty"".  When you're a kid every moment is memorable because so much shit is novel and new to you.  Your brain is in overdrive trying to catalog and make sense of it all.  When you're older and fall into routine and experience novelty less then your brain starts slacking off and making shortcuts because you really don't need to remember a random Tuesday where nothing happened at work for the 900th time in a row.

Neurologists say if you want to ""slow down"" your life then you need to experience novelty again and at a consistent rate.  Be constantly improving just like when you were 6.  Go to new places, meet new people, etc. and your perception of time will change."

Freshman year I was so carefree running around the halls going to dorm parties and trying to get into house parties, then Sophomore year came and I lived in an apartment and got the sophomore slump, then junior year I studied abroad in an awesome country and explored new places, and now I’m getting ready to start a career.

But despite how hard it might be to leave in a couple of months, I really do feel prepared for the next step and feel like I got everything I could out of this place. 

So, a little unsolicited advice to all you freshman: Always remember, You’re not just in college to get a degree, but to make crazy memories, fail and learn, do things that scare you, go on random trips, and make lifelong friends.

For me a phone call with my mom and walking down the hall or around the block has done so much for panic attacks if I’m able to catch it soon enough.

jslplay,fe3imaa,t1_fe0ico9,"Thank you for your advice. Yes, I get anxiety and panic attacks. They started in middle school because the constant pressure of ""getting As"" on tests overwhelmed me. I do not exercise but I should (I'm skinny). I should find ways to socialize with people more often trying to change locations with them then."
sieffy,fe0afqf,t1_fe0aa3b,I say that to myself and I’m doing good in school but I feel like I don’t actually like anyone at my school. Nobody feels right and like someone I would hang with. I feel out of my element even when I try to socialize more than usual
RedditYankee,fe69o64,t1_fe2p8d0,"That’s definitely rough. I go to my schools gym and while the large number of people can definitely be intimidating, everyone is more concerned with how they look than how others look. There is a small percentage of people who will put others down at the gym unfortunately, but they likely have their own problems so I wouldn’t worry about them too much. Check out /r/fitness if you haven’t already, it should help you see that everyone in the gym is there for their own reasons! Any time you see someone in the gym it’s because they also want to look and feel better :)"
RedditYankee,fe69rx2,t1_fe3imaa,I believe in you! I think I read somewhere that doing something for 2 weeks is enough to make it a habit. I challenge you to go to the gym every day for 2 weeks and see how you feel! Lots of great info in the wiki of /r/fitness for beginners

The reason, as I guess, is the following: you have more mundane tasks to do. Studying ,preparing for tests, maintaining your room in a dorm in a proper conditions, cooking, paying bills, working part-time, etc. It doesn't feels like something new, so this time is not felt by you (or me) at all. 

As a kid you have a lot of freedom and that is why it feels like time goes sloooow. Howhewer, as an adult you don't have that much time to spend for what ever you desire. So I guess that is why."

OwThatHertz,fe5egf3,t3_enj55m,"I would posit that it's less about being in college and more about the fact that you'd doing something so fast-paced for the first time in your life.  I'm older, going to school as well (also for engineering), and time has actually kind of slowed down after starting school after having worked in industry for a couple of decades.

Why does this matter?  It may be an indication that you are having trouble with the stress.  Stress can destroy your sense of well-being if you don't do something to manage it.  It can impact your grades and cause you to overwork yourself when you study and undermine you when taking tests.

Don't worry, though; this is a solvable problem!  I would recommend that you reach out to your adviser and ask them if your school offers any workshops in stress management or offers an on-campus counselor, as many campuses do.  They can help you figure out how to best cope with the stress, and this is an important skillset to have.  The stress you feel now will continue as you start working in industry and have demands with deadlines just like you do currently in school.  Learning to manage it now is a skill that you will be able to use throughout your life.

Another piece of advice I'd offer is to find something you enjoy in each class, even (or especially!) in classes you aren't specifically interested in and/or hate.  For me, it was math, and I started trying to find the practical application wherever I could.  As a result, I hated algebra until we got to formulas for decay because that's applicable to determining things like the half-life of isotopes, and I'm interested in building a nuclear cloud chamber.  I actually really enjoyed trig/precalc because that's where the real-world, practical application started to come in.  (For example, using law of cosign/sin to solve triangle angles and length is directly applicable to issues like search and rescue, determine real-world size of things, etc.)  Although some of these are a little contrived, it keeps me interested and engaged in subjects that might otherwise be frustrating.  In chemistry, it's learning that solids don't just magically melt in liquid; they are literally separated and surrounded by other molecules, or why steel wool actually gains weight when you burn it rather than losing weight because it oxidizes and gains new atoms.

Enjoy your time at college!  Although it seems stressful, this is going to be some of the most free exploration time you will have in your life.  You're focused almost entirely on learning and connecting with people (don't forget to network!  folks you meet now will get you your future jobs!) in ways that simply isn't nearly as easy (or even possible, sometimes)."

GodInThisChilis,fe6knmx,t3_envzzl,"Good luck. I had a similar experience, kind of. My first two years were awful and I was extremely depressed, gained 45 pounds, no friends, and had a 2.3 GPA. My parents got divorced as well. 

Two weeks before the semester ended in May, I decided I was going to move back home (to California) and move in with my aunt. My university has like 10 online degree programs and mine just happened to be close to one of them, so I changed my degree from criminology to criminal justice and finished my bachelors online from 1,000+ miles away. 

From the time I began full online courses until graduation, I had a 4.0 GPA. I ended up completing more than half of my degree (72 credit hours) in a year and a half and graduated early in 3.5 years this past December. It was the absolute best decision I could’ve made, both for my academic status and for my own mental health. I never enjoyed college life and felt very distant and isolated from all of my peers. Allowing myself to work at my own pace, alone, did wonders for my motivation and success in college. 

If your university offers full online coursework, I recommend that you absolutely look into it. Especially since you only have one semester left, I imagine it shouldn’t be too difficult to finish your last few classes online. Also, as someone else mentioned, get a therapist. Can’t be said enough. I think every person in the world should go to therapy and that everyone can benefit from it, and it’s something my family has always sworn by. I really hope this works out for you!"

I’ve also considered going the route of traditional “organizing” and just devoting my career to prison reform in general and finding an organization whose mission I like and try to find a role for myself there. 

Let me know if you have any other questions. I’ve found my career goals to be wildly different than my peers who are interested in law enforcement (I’m extremely uninterested in that) mainly so I understand if my comment isn’t very helpful"
Inactive_Account,fe69hky,t3_envzzl,"My biggest piece of advice is to seek therapy and get help now.  I get it, college is stressful, but he working world is often harder than college.  If you just decided that you can't deal with it and wanted to work from home, not many industries can allow that. You would lose your job. There's an issue that you need to work through or at least learn coping strategies to mitigate."
chaoscontrols,fe6g7i3,t1_fe69hky,"For sure, I’ve been in therapy for years and I thought I was getting better but I can definitely admit that I’ve regressed and I need to do what I can to get back in track. I definitely do worry about work in the future so it’ll be good to be proactive and get some new coping strategies for that too. Thank you so much for your advice, I hope you have a great semester :)"
OrangeEarPlugz,fe6kw2o,t1_fe69hky,"Yeah this is good advice.  I have quit many jobs because I went through what you're going through.  You don't show up and that's that.  It's totally okay to do, as long as you know the consequences.  Don't let anyone guilt you into doing some shit you feel isn't in your best interest.  Just know the risk/reward."
rgp1235,fe6kne0,t3_envzzl,"Difficult to tell what you need advice on or if you just need affirmation, so I'll do both. First off, it's alright. There is clearly more going on here to cause a breakdown beyond just the flight. Take a breath, calm yourself. Second, once you are home and have some free time, figure out what's going on internally. Why did you have a breakdown? External help by a counselor might be needed in figuring that out. Lastly and what I find most important, work on building mental resilience. I'm all about mental health/care, but resilience is more about learning how to handle challenges for the future. A counselor can help you with some of this as well."

Knute5,fe7tvsx,t3_envzzl,"If it were me, the first question would be ""Why?"" Why are you so depressed about going back to school? Is it college or the career you're training for? Life is long and right now you don't have anyone else to carry. It would be a lot worse if you felt this way about going to a job when you had a spouse and kids.

This is a gift. Be brutally honest with yourself now (and good on ya for reaching out) and best of luck discovering what you really want to do."
shagbarksghost,fe6s651,t3_envzzl,"I totally understand. I had to quit mid-semester (as well as my job) back in fall because my mental health declined so sharply that I was hospitalized when I nearly attempted suicide on the clock at work. I still kind of feel bad because my parents are still paying off the wasted tuition money (it was too late for a refund by the time I realized I needed to quit). But I'm actually better than I've ever been in my life now, and looking back, it was worth it. I don't think I'll be going back to college (for several reasons), but I don't think it was really for me anyway. All I can say is hang in there and focus on getting help and getting well again. You'll get there sooner than you know!"

Speaking from experience, it's 110% worth it to put yourself in the environment that will support your mental health, even if that means taking a different path than most people. The rewards might be hard to recognize sometimes but you'll do far better than if you had pushed yourself back into a situation that drove you mad. Best of luck, you can do this."
fadedrejoice,fe6mmwm,t3_envzzl,I wish you the best of luck. I also decided to not return to school this semester because it is literally the worst thing for my mental health despite being relatively close to graduating. You have to do what you know is best for you.

Sending good vibes, hope your dean will let you take your classes online, OP!! I completely understand how harsh school can be for people mentally. I failed my first 2 semesters and dropped out. I'm going back but I was not mentally okay when I was in school the first time. I'm so ready for it now tho! I hope everything turns out great OP!"

I just wanna not eat to end both my problems. I have no friends all I do is study and I’m starting to break now. I love studying and it used to distract me from my hatred of this place but it’s not enough anymore. My grades are good but I’ve had enough of this my life sucks ass let’s face it it needs to go"
Denalin,fe6tsq8,t1_fe6rxyg,"Hey there, please try to speak with a counselor if your school has one. I pushed through and graduated - barely - on time but was miserable for long periods of time and deeply regret not telling anybody at the time. I looked at everyone else and assumed “there’s something different and shitty about me, these people just don’t feel bad and I do” - over time I’ve found (or at least taught myself to believe) that life’s not easy for anybody but some people have been better trained to navigate the tough parts and we’re just trying to catch up.

Also, can’t say it’ll work for you and I’m sure you’ve read a ton about this, but I found IBS symptoms to decrease when I improved my diet (fewer fried foods, no coffee or alcohol), got 8-9 hrs sleep daily, and reduced stress sources. Thankfully, after addressing this, I’ve been able to slowly reintroduce some of the more unhealthy foods and coffee without issue.

As for friends, there are likely people who feel the way you do. There may be clubs or groups with similar interests, have you thought of joining one?

Edit: oh also, something that really has helped me with a lot of things is kind of silly but it works — placebo effect / mind over matter — I tell myself I’m going to get better, fake it ‘til I make it, and usually just telling myself I will be better helps me actually get better."
smores024,fe7u9on,t3_envzzl,Hi I don’t really have any words of advice (but I am going through something v similar) and I just wanted to say good luck and I’m wishing you all the best!! I wish I was as brave as you are!!
Amac500512,fe7vzun,t3_envzzl,I hope it all works out but I guess it’s helping prepare you for the real world cause life can really throw some curve balls and also I hope you have the best time you can!

FickleCar,fe8l5mm,t3_envzzl,Do it because you are happy. Being happy is the number one rule in life. It will all work out. Trust me. :). Good job for getting this far but you are almost there.
SnowblindAlbino,fe8rkcy,t3_envzzl,"Take a semester of leave-- it's certainly early enough to get a 100% refund on tuition. Don't try to do therapy and school at the same time. Focus on yourself now, school later.

It's unlikely that a distance solution will be offered, unless your school already does most of its classes that way. Not actually attending class is not a ""reasonable accommodation"" in most cases like this. I've had many students end up struggling with mental health issues and the usual solution is a semester of leave for treatment, then either easing back in part time or wrapping things up in a single semester."
arugulafanclub,fe9cm3s,t3_envzzl,"I’m guessing it isn’t school that’s the issue but fear of your future — did you pick the right major? What will happen after graduation? What you’re experiencing is normal. I’d see a counselor about this. It sounds like anxiety and you can manage it but you don’t want it to build up more so see a counselor and career counselor, talk to your parents. Finish your degree. You’re almost there."
ClassyHotMess,fe9k6dy,t3_envzzl,"You have to do what’s best for you and your mental health! My last semester of college killed me, literally my mental health was so bad. I ended up not getting my degree and it took me three years to finally go back and finish. I just finished up last semester but I know I never would have been able to do it before the three years. 

It’s hard honestly but you can do it! If you can’t take them online then take the semester to yourself and register either next semester or summer (if you’re ready)."
HugeRichard11,fe6rpeq,t3_envzzl,"Do you just have senioritis and are getting to the point of tiredness of school. It's pretty normal and unfortunately can only be cured by taking a semester off or working through it as best you can. 

I'm in a similar place just tired of the structure of school so I now don't worry about it that much and have let my grades slip but it's for the best.

Talking about it with a professional should definitely help guide you on what you feel are the hurdles stopping you and what not."

This_is_your_mind,fe8nkr9,t1_fe8nc95,"Okay that's a totally valid point and I realize here that I did a full 180. College isn't for everyone though, and some people could probably use a semester off to either figure that out, or learn how to deal with it in a way that isn't absolutely dreadful."
DaDaDaDJ,fe8nwp4,t1_fe8nkr9,"I mean if you've gone through 7 semesters you can ""suffer"" through 1 more."

I kept noticing that a bunch of squirrels were hanging out by the side of a particular building, and then one day I saw someone open their office widow and throw a couple handfuls of unshelled peanuts onto the grass. This person had what was probably a 5lb bag of peanuts in there, and was obviously getting quite a following."
Rumplestilskin_9,fdpbkm3,t3_emcq4e,"Well if you put it like that then, they are brown, furry and small. They are classified as Funambulus palmarum meaning Indian palm squirrel. The characteristic feature of this species is that they have 3 strips on their back and they run very very fast. They also have less bushy tail usually a gradient of black, brown and white.

The two outer stripes run from the forelegs to the hind legs only. It has a creamy-white belly and a tail covered with interspersed, long, black and white hair. The ears are small and triangular. Juvenile squirrels have significantly lighter coloration, which gets progressively darker as they age. Albinism is rare, but exists in this species. Their eyes are a bit dark maroonish and like beads.

They survive on fruits and nuts basically.

That's all I know about the squirrels in my University."

Squirrels are super common and like to steal things from any person, they don't give a duck and usually end up fighting for food. Some of them even give birth under stairs, in the basement of buildings or even inside the classroom (one day we found a mother squirrel with her babies in one of the 5th floor's classrooms).

Theres a big thing with people not accepting anxiety or depression as a real issue. It just makes you a target. Ive heard ""Everyones depressed, but we still do what needs to be done, why cant you?""

It isn't, right. That's similar. It's not okay to feel uncontrollably anxious and losing your functionality due to anxiety, just because everybody feels anxious every now and then. It's not okay to feel dreadfully bad every day and night, losing sleep and appetite, just because everybody feels under the weather a day or two. These are disorders, medical problems.

yUmmmmmie,fdlpusv,t3_elzg04,"My second semester back I had about a month of daily anxiety attacks. Its was horrible and exhausting. I was just a mess and I was miserable. My old doctor started trying to get me on medication but kept trying to get me to take meds which made no sense and caused either worse anxiety or made me sick to my stomach. I actually left that doctor shortly after. 

I ended up returning to my old friend welbutrin for help when I needed it during that time. I like welbutrin because I can take it when I need it, and pass when I dont. Once my anxiety and body was under better control I realized I needed a study plan based on what works best for me. I got super organized and had a plan. I also started getting my husband and family to take over some tasks to lighten my load. Things like grocery shopping or doing a couple loads of laundry may seem small but when you can have people do those things for you it lightens your load and lessens the stress. Things slowly improved.

Now I have a study plan based on my learning style and ability, a plan to succeed, and a lot more help. So heres my best advice. First get the anxiety under control with the help of medication or therapy. Next attack the triggers that are bringing the stress up. Is it grades or family? What's causing it? Or are you simply overburdened and need to ask for help? 

Lastly, while the anxiety was severe in my case it did stop and didn't last forever. Now I'm no longer taking meds but I have them in case I need them. Sometimes just having a plan can really reduce the anxiety from the get go.

GL"
skosk8ski,fdnftmq,t1_fdlpusv,"I’m taking Wellbutrin too. Didn’t know you could take it periodically. I’ve been taking it every day for a while so would I not have withdrawals if I stopped? Also I found that Wellbutrin increased my anxiety instead. It helps with motivation and energy for me, but they put me on lexapro for anxiety. Do you notice similar effects with Wellbutrin?"
yUmmmmmie,fdnh8vl,t1_fdnftmq,"So everyones different and definitely ask your doctor before doing anything. In my experience personally with welbutrin I did about 3 months of tapering down or skipping days and if I felt ok I continued down in mg, and I told my doctor although he was wanting me to stay on and fully medicated. Welbutrin can actually make some people more anxious because its peppy. Its tuff because some of the other antianxiety meds are bad news. It also depends I think on the type of anxiety you have. For me I had anxiety and that was causing depression. The depression was making me want to stay home and do nothing. So the welbutrin helped me break thru and get my ducks in order, which helped with the anxiety because I had plans to meet my goals, and the depression dissapeared because life improved. Today I take nothing for anxiety. But some days I can actually feel the anxiety building up in my body and I just know an attack is possible- so I'll take a welbutrin and get focused and feel more in control of my surroundings because I'm not going over every thing in my mind a thousand times. It really depends on your body and situation, like are you experiencing what is referred to as situation anxiety or is it biologically related? Then things get even trickier with adding other meds into the mix. 
Prior to welbutrin I had a lot of success with Zoloft which handled the social anxiety and depression really well, but I was a zombie at the higher doses. But I know people that hate that drug too ... just trust your gut. 

If you dont have depression, and let's say you are not like staying home, avoiding people, closing your self down - then you probably don't need the pep that welbutrin brings to the table - instead opt for something a little less stimulating. But no, I never had withdrawals on it and its effectiveness for me for as needed is my lifeline. Also, it took about a month to become acclimated to the drug properly."

I would check in and see if counseling is available if you feel like that would help you. I definitely don't want you to feel pressured into doing it if you don't feel comfortable with it.

If you overstep a boundary, you know your limit. However, facing fear makes you a little bit stronger. Things that give you anxiety will do so a little less. It won't be easy, but if you can do something once, know that you can do it twice.

gaydrian304,fdm9lsb,t3_elzg04,"I’m more familiar with US colleges/universities, so I hope this is helpful. I’d go to the student health center and look into the counseling they have available on campus. It’s confidential and they can refer you out into the community if you don’t want anyone on campus seeing you in there. 

If you get a diagnosis you can also work with the program on your campus for students with disabilities (this term is broad and can be anything from mental to physical health) and they can set you up with accommodations specific to your needs. Like note takers or docs for your professor explaining the accommodations you need (again this stays confidential even if you give a professor documentation). 

Lastly to echo what everyone else is saying: take it one step at a time! Ease yourself into situations that you can foresee giving you anxiety. It’ll take time, but you’ll find people who are likeminded eventually. Don’t sell yourself short! Good luck out there!

Oh and one last thing, most of the health and disability service offices are open before the semester starts, maybe try to go before those places get crowded."

Philofmyfuture7813,fdnh97z,t3_elzg04,"This really depends on where you live. US has a system. Universities have an opportunity I think you can try. Go to counseling, try to see the psychiatrist and get their sign off to the disabilities center that you have anxiety so that if it bothers you to the point where attendance or assignments sometimes aren’t possible to do in time this becomes flexible. This is something you can take on with your professors called flexible schedule or attendance. Having all of this in order to back you up without messing up your grade helps ease the anxiety. An example is: say one professor’s policy is that for every class missed after two classes, they deduct a third of a letter grade, well for me they make it every two classes or something after four days missed for the semester. Most of my anxiety cane from having to take a full course load, taking care of my sick mom, myself, and taking care of the house.  Sometimes the disabilities center will work with you to find a psychiatrist appointment on campus if your situation is super rough and “temporary” like mine. I’m pretty sure you can do your work, you probably just need a little bit of extra time. And if you get your sign off to the disabilities center and then talk to your professors from there they tend to be very willing to set up a flexed schedule for attendance and assignments as long as you don’t push it. It’s all about giving yourself what you need."

Friday I start at 4 and drive till the rides die down or I am to tired. I do school work between classes and on sat and sunday. I don't drive at night if I need school work time. That gets me 700 a week if I drive all that. If I take time off for classes the money goes down. Some drivers in other markets make more in the same time.
ikilledtupac,fdhos5t,t1_fdhft2h,Smart.
Korzald,fdiwci1,t1_fdhordq,Yes you should disclose but the company's cover you if you have a run or passenger. Ride share insurance fills the gap between waiting for a pick up getting one.
ikilledtupac,fdj1knm,t1_fdiwci1,Not always. Many have specific exclusions on the application and policy forms now.
Korzald,fdjnf5s,t1_fdj1knm,"The compay's are uber, lyft, grub hub, and door dash. So they always cover when you have a ride or delivery. But insurance companies will not cover if you have the app on and are waiting for a pick up. So that is what rideshare insurance covers."

This semester will be the end of my junior year. So far, my cumulative GPA is a 3.68. I generally stay pretty tired during the times of class and work together but overall I’m pretty satisfied with the results thus far. Can be very mentally challenging and burnout becomes a very real thing though. To each their own, there is no right way to do life."

Office_Chairs_Canada,fdhbjr8,t3_elcmhp,"Time management is not a big deal if we put some real effort into organizing our day to day stuff in the right balance between college, job, and studies. First of all, we have to take our own time to put in order our priorities. Let me give some points which helped me to cope with this.

1. Starting slowly. Not committing to work a lot of hours immediately. This will put us under immense pressure. It is better to get the ball rolling slow and steady.

2. Making a To-do list. We can make a list of points regarding anything which we've to complete in a particular time frame. It can be either our studies or work.

3. Prioritizing it. If we don't prioritize our works we'll end up in doing nothing. So it is better to mention what to do first and last.

4. Being attentive and taking a lot of notes in the classes. This way we don't have to spend so much time recollecting the points while we study.

5. Having a quality sleep. It is very important to have quality sleep than quantity sleep. Scientifically it is referred to as REM ( Rapid Eye Movement ) sleep. You can google it later. :) So don't forget to sleep on time.

6. Wake up as early as possible. Doing some exercises help us to focus our state of mind. Exercises work in the same way sleep does.

7. Looking through our To-do list and class notes. Make sure that we're not keeping anything for pending till date and studying as well.

In my case, it is the opposite. I'm working full time and doing my part-time studies along with the job. But still, I apply the same principles which seem well effective.

Hope this helps. :)"
Darkporky,fdhnjla,t1_fdhbjr8,"I agree with you, right now I'm not following this and its been tough. When I did follow this rules it helped a lot though. My main problem right now is lack of sleep. This last semester I worked during the nights (until 2 or 3am) and I studied all day with only 3 or 4 hours between classes and my jobs. This meant that sometimes I had to get out of work at 2am to finish some assignments (art major, so art projects) and then go directly back to class without slept at all. I slept during class a lot, and managed to pass because others knew my situation and helped me with my art history material."

OoglieBooglie93,fdhgj5t,t3_elcmhp,"I worked 36 hours a week doing production work with a 35 mile commute one way to school 5 days a week for a year, studying mechanical engineering. I still went balls to the wall with my senior design project and put 30+ hours most weeks on that alone in the second semester (my subsystem ended up being far more complicated than anyone expected), and got an A in senior design and both of the other classes I was taking (Technically, it was part time at 9 credit hours, but I would argue that amount of work on my senior design project qualifies me for this question).

How did I do it? I stopped screwing around. I did assignments as they were assigned, not the day they were due. I stayed up until the middle of the night if that's what it took to get everything done on time. Spite's a hell of a drug. Get something to piss you off enough and you'll do whatever it takes to get something done. Embrace the attitude of ""Vroom vroom bitches"".

Darkporky,fdho5r9,t1_fdhej54,"My guess is that its easier to schedule 4 different work shifts around the day than schedule 1 long shift. I used to work at Mcdonald's while studying and shorters shifts through out the week were easier than the 8 houra shifts overnight they used to give me.

The 2 long shifts end at around 11 pm, so it does affect my sleeping, especially when I end up staying awake for 2-3 more hours just winding down from working and checking up on some things. Having an 8 am class this semester will definitely change that habit lol."

I either work jobs that are high paying and freelance or lower paying and passive so I can do work or apply for full time jobs on the down time. On campus jobs tend to be really relaxed and offer a lot of down time to study
SuperDogBoo,fdi4bqn,t1_fdha9sv,"My campus job is definitely not passive, but I work at a food spot, so I have to cook, fry, etc. However, one of my days I work is when the company is closed so I get to do food prep while listening to music or youtube videos. Doesn't pay well, but it is on campus and they give a good amount of hours. I only worked 14-15 last semester (my choice mostly) but am increasing that to about 17 this semester.

&#x200B;

What jobs do you have that are more passive or offer study time?"
AppleJaxHammer,fdili4b,t1_fdi4bqn,"Tech support, AV support, front desk of library, and teachers assistant. A lot of sitting down jobs or anything that involves office hours tends to be easy money and you can study in your down time. I've never worked with food on campus tbh"

I plan out everything from the day I get my syllabus.  I plan off days, I plan study days, I refuse to have a social life the majority of the semester except for the occasional happy hour and Sunday Brunch.  

The best piece of advice I can give is time management and prioritize work and school over everything.   If you are in a relationship plan date nights ahead of time and if you have children plan time with them throughout the week. 

Once you get into a good schedule/routine it becomes less stressful and more manageable.  However, finals can be a major bitch if you don’t start studying earlier than the average student."
catatott,fdhiojd,t3_elcmhp,"I'm working 35-40 hrs a week as a teacher, and full time college at night. Running on legit 5-6 hrs of sleep is fucking exhausting. It leaves you with no time for a life, or for your own sanity tbh. Feeling sick and need a doctor? Too bad your working. Need to go grocery shopping? Better get good at doing it in the middle of the night. 

Managing it is more like understanding that it's best for you long-term, and there isn't much other choice if you want to afford school and high af housing prices."
Scorpion1386,fdlk663,t1_fdhiojd,Sounds like you need more self care.
currencybored,fdhmqih,t3_elcmhp,"I worked 3 part time jobs in college in New York. I was an econ major/IT minor. In some ways I did not manage well at all. I cried a lot and still barely made enough money to afford anything. In the mornings I was a lifeguard for the YMCA, then I would go to class, then I would lifeguard in the evenings for a retirement community, and on the weekends I waitress-ed. Altogether I was working like 45-60 hours per week. I kept a spreadsheet of all my hours in the hopeless delusion of making rent.  

My honest advice is to try and find a job with a lot of downtime so that you have time to work on schoolwork. My job at the retirement community was like this. I would also work at the desk there sometimes for this purpose. If I didn't get my homework done at work, I'd go straight to my school's computer lab afterwards and refuse to leave until I had all of my work done for the following day. I couldn't even begin to tell you how many times I watched the sunrise in while sitting in that place. 

It worked though. My last semester I finished with a 3.7 GPA. The reason it worked is that the schedule was constant. I was also making sure I didn't have any real downtime, because if I did, I'd start to freak out. I organized my life so that I wouldn't have time to think about how shit it was. 

It was certainly not ideal but it built character and work ethic I guess. I have a good job now and my mental health has much improved."
Mewmewkissycutiee,fdhtmom,t3_elcmhp,"I work 40 and go to school for 12-15 units (semester) with summers.

I am extremely lucky because I have a job (Security) where I have enough downtime that I can get all my homework done in the 8 hours. We probably do a max of two hours of work. I can afford to live walking distance to school which makes it so I don’t have to pay gas, $600/year parking permit where I probs wouldn’t find parking anyways, and I can get some exercise in.

Downsides are that I have to work the swing shift every day except mon/weds, so there is no such thing as a weekend/ I have to show up super late to friend hangouts when I’m too tired to hang for long anyways. I also live in a HCOL area though, and have a financed car which adds to it. Rent is $780/mo for a tiny 9x10 room. And I have medical debt. No family to fall back on.

I have enough to make it work but if I skip a day without PTO, I’ll be behind. It’s stressful sometimes but it seems to be working for now."

I have more money than I know what to do with because I don't have time to spend money. When something comes up financially, I'm not worried because I have been inadvertently saving this whole time. It's hard, but it truly is worth it IMO. 

Also, respect your health. Know when to call off work. Know when to stop studying and REST. Know when to set boundaries with others. If you are disciplined and have good time management skills, you can do it."

JaiX1234,fdhfl9v,t3_elcmhp,"It really depends on your situation.

If you absolutely need to work for necessities then you should prioritize work over school. As no money means no school, no meeting the bare minimum to survive means no school, etc.

However, if you're just working to have some side money then school should be your priority.

If you're in the middle then I would say C's are good enough and focus mostly on work. Work experience will ultimately be more valuable later on when job searching."
ftmxagan,fdh8fyx,t3_elcmhp,I’ve had two jobs since August and last semester I took 16 hours.

Yea, so that was 60 hours of studying and classes combined, plus at least 40-50 hours of work and as it turned out, my internship was in a different city than my college, so 7 hours of driving back and forth every week. 107-117 hours of just straight work/studying every single week. I couldn't even think about extracurriculars.

My GPA wasn't so great that year... I had to take some time for myself to recharge from the hectic-ness and I couldn't take off at my internship every time I was tired since it would look bad so that time came out of my studying time.

idkisawitonline,fdhmc4m,t3_elcmhp,"I’m taking 17 credit hours at school which is 1.5 hours away, each way. I work 25-30 hours a week, usually split between the weekend days. My program is extremely rigorous and sometimes I have 12 hour clinical days, and multiple days a week that require me to leave my house at 4AM. I’m also completing an undergraduate thesis and will graduate with honors. 

Here’s my advice:
I know I can’t work and go to class in the same day. I don’t work well after being mentally exhausted so I make sure that my work days and school days are separate. But, that’s just me. 

Studying after I’ve worked all day usually is counterproductive for me and just results in less sleep. I study on class days, and sometimes I study in the breaks between classes. In the event that I have a quick assignment to do, I will do it on my lunch break for work, but usually I use that time to relax. Sometimes I have had to pull all-nighters to study. (I don’t recommend that) 

Communication with your employer/your managers is crucial. There have been times where I let them know that I had a test, and I was the one that was put on-call or sent home early. 

Know your limits. You’re only one person and you can only do so much. The difference between an A and a B+ isn’t worth sacrificing your mental health."

waateey,fdhqo1w,t3_elcmhp,"I take about 15-17 credit hours every semester, with my school days lasting from about 9-5:30 every day of the week. On top of this I have a part time job at a theme park, as well as work study in my major's department and theatre design gigs every few months that take up about a 2 month period (as well as working on shows at school). I definitely don't recommend this if you can avoid having to work so much while in school. I do this this mainly because I love my work and because my parents can't really support me financially while I'm in school as far as rent and gas and such.

My advice is get a calendar system that works for, stick to it and update and reference it constantly. I prefer Google calendar, because I can access it on any device and I can dedicate different calenders to different things. For instance I made a ""friends stuff"" and a ""family stuff"" calendar in addition to the normal work and show calenders. This has saved my life since starting college. 

Other tips, make time for sleep and hobbies. And if you find yourself deciding between anything and sleep, choose sleep, you'll be better off for it. If you can get full 8-10 hours of rest every night, you're golden. Try to fit in hobbies and hanging out with friends and family when you can, it a great way to relax and unwind after a lot of work. In relation to this, also take time for yourself to be just by yourself.

And final thing, if you are a party animal and think you can do work and school full time and party, it won't work out well, and I'm going to highly suggest against it."

I tried my best to not feel bad about taking time to rest!!! I did therapy, which helped a lot with anxiety and stress, but it was still a lot to deal with. I also never really went out. 
I managed to graduate with magna cum laude, which was pretty rad, considering i broke my back my junior year & had to have surgery in the middle of my spring semester."

I told my manager I was going back to school and would try my absolute best to schedule classes around work and they were fully on board and extended the whole ""let me know if there's anything I can do to help or if you need resources about our company's tuition policy."" Granted, I'm only taking 1 class at a time right now since the program I want to go into is limited enrollment. 

Most places will understand, especially if it's a ""dead end"" place. They should be even more on board if you are going to school for something that can be considered ""in that field."" 

Just try to manage your time - it might take a bit to get right. Make sure you take care of yourself and don't over do anything you don't need to (never sleeping, eating like junk, excessive spending, etc)."

I had one night off every week and it was nice but as long as you have stricter and can put yourself out and do it it works but if you aren’t focused enough it can slip a little and feel really heavy to deal with.

While I have an 8 am class this semester on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I have more breaks between classes which will give me more time to get things done. Last semester, my MWF classes didn't start till 11 or 12, which meant I spent most of that time sleeping in bed. While that was nice, I didn't have as much time to get stuff done.

I am a lifeguard so it’s always long and boring hours but I make a lot of money. I work Tuesday’s and Thursday’s for 6 hours and then on the weekend for 13 hours. My second job is a Communications assistant for my city. About 70% of it is online. So in between classes or if I need a break from studying, I answer emails or make some posts. So each week I typically work 28-32 hours each week plus school. The key is time management and exercise. I really love using an agenda and the reminder app on my phone. I also exercise 3-4 times a week. It really helps with stress and gives me a break from everything. It gets busy some weeks, especially midterm season but stick to a routine and it’ll be easy!"

Spring semester I will have 3 online and 2 in person classes that start at 6:00pm.

My main tactic is to knock out as much homework as early in the week as possible. Monday I’ll get as much done as possible. Everyday I arrive at work an hour early in the morning to do some homework before work. I use my lunch break to do another hour of homework. I’m really lucky that my work schedule is stable, so it’s easy to make a reliable study schedule.  This works really well for me because I’m able to have some free time in the evenings.

Two are on-campus, and two are off-campus. Having multiple jobs really helps with flexibility in schedules (one in the morning, one at night, one on weekends, etc.), but it’s also super challenging keeping track of things. I ended up printing off my class schedule in time-block form, and then taping over it with wide clear tape. It really helps because I’m able to write in my work schedules with dry-erase markers and I don’t have the anxiety of thinking “oh crap, what’s next?” Hang in there; it gets easier the more you do it (even if it may feel like it’s not). Also: My god, the relief in the summer when you’re done with classes (or you cut back on the number of classes) and all you have to do is work— that feeling is magical."
wand3rlust_,fdj4wx6,t3_elcmhp,"I always had two part-time jobs, sometimes 3. During my undergrad, it was easier because the jobs were more casual, except my main one which was serving. I switched with co workers when I had exams and just prioritized my time really well. 

When I was doing my masters I worked 3 days one week, 4 days the next, interchangeably. So it was almost full time. I lucked out being able to schedule my courses so I had two weekdays off 9-5, when my job took place. I took lots of night classes. 

It was also an office job in a marketing team so I did have an opportunity to do some reading or research stuff on my downtime. I also got a part-time did working at a front desk in the evenings and always had 3-4 hours per shift to do homework. Look into working as a concierge in a hotel or condo residence.

tullah123,fdjd3fm,t3_elcmhp,"I did this for a little over two years while pursuing my associates. **I am now completely burnt out.**

I would work between 35-55 hrs at my retail jobs, they were understanding with school. If I was depressed or just stressed I would go down to 30-35 for a week or two and then get back to it. Rather than working 7 days a week I would do doubles consistently 5-6 days per week. Sometimes that meant working from 9am-11pm other times it meant morning/afternoon classes then straight to work. I will say that most jobs aren't ok with such blocked off availability though.

At the time I was very focused and honestly managed to get through it well. Now i'm a junior working only 20-30 hrs but I still feel drained from that period. Technically I have second job where I can choose each week whether I want to pick up weekend shifts. This kind of 2 job situation is 100x better."

Despite this, I felt super groggy and would stay up until 2am every night and had morning 8am classes.

So I decided to have 1 day a week where I did not work, and I did not study. That was sunday.

I felt so much better having sunday just to sleep and relax.

I recommend if you are attempting this, to have 1 day a week where you can just relax (because you will probably be up late due to working/school.) And I recommend going for jobs that aren't ""work heavy."" Look for jobs that allow you to get paid to study. For example: A security guard job (one where you watch cameras), librarian. tutor, even animal breeding (depending on the species.)

And I can’t do homework or anything because I have to be watching her at all times.) 

Honesty trying to balance all of this last semester was difficult- to put it lightly. I ended up getting an incomplete in one class (it doesn’t impact my GPA though, thank god). I am a try-hard 4.0 student so getting an incomplete is extremely out of character for me.

I think the biggest thing I have learned is that I NEED to use a physical planner next semester. I missed a decent number of assignments because I just was not checking my syllabi enough or the stuff I put in my phone. I also missed a desk shift or two because I straight up just forgot. You think you can remember everything but it very quickly becomes too much.

Also please PLEASE monitor your mental health. Take a day to yourself here and there when possible. I drained myself last semester and am now seeing a psychiatrist because it got so bad. 

Sorry that was a lot of rambling. All in all it is very possible, you just need to be on your A-game and be self-aware to make sure you don’t end up messing with your health, (Literally schedule time to eat too!!)

Pack your own lunch if you can. It’s cheaper than eating out each time, and a dude’s gotta eat. 

You’ll probably have a few breaks in between classes too. I used to sleep through them, but I found that it only made me groggy before the next class. Instead, I started taking walks around the campus to get a change of scenery or doing some school work in the library.

My advice: 

* Pack lots of food and water. I was packing lunch, dinner, and multiple snacks to get me through the day, along with a water bottle. Occasionally I would treat myself to dinner out, but not too often. 
* Bring some textbooks and get some studying done in your down time. This might just be me, but I'm much more productive at school than at home, so I didn't really mind this. 
* Have a break and take some time to yourself. For me, I would go to the university pool, meet up with a friend for a bit, or even watch some Netflix. It made the day much more bearable. 
* Get some exercise throughout the day. Doesn't have to be a super hard gym workout if that's not your thing, but walking on the track, going swimming, or even taking a walk around campus is helpful to get up and get your blood flowing. I feel much better after getting some exercise opposed to sitting at a table or desk for the entire day."

Identify which classes are going to give you the most daily work and make sure you make note of all important dates where something is due.

Find a nice place on campus to relax or study in during huge breaks. Don't force yourself to be productive every second you're not in class. Breaks are so important. If you have trouble finding time to take long breaks (back to back classes, etc), the food and hydration part is super extra important. Always try to make time for at least a 20 minute break here and there though."
datesaremyfave,fead98g,t3_eo50o7,"Iva done this every semester. Extremely doable depending on the person. I personally take 3 hr classes and try to limit the 2 day a week ones. It makes it feel like it’s going faster

I always eat out and that’s something I look forward to going onto campus. I will say be aware of any exams. Some days I would have two in a row (professor told our class later that if we would have told her that we could’ve switched our exam. Everyone in the class was in the other class as well)

Be on top of your homework and stuff. Pretty difficult to do during another class. Make sure you read the syllabus and see if the class allows for tech or not, you can take a breather during these but make sure you don’t get too far behind"
Sraniale,feadfn1,t3_eo50o7,"Last semester, my schedule was 9-6. I ended class 5:15 but the bus usually had already left just as I got there or it was late. Honestly, the only thing that kept me going every day was the mandatory attendance for one of my classes but other than that, stay caffeinated and get good sleep. Otherwise, the day will feel super slow. 

Bring a textbook, start studying for a class, or just bring a pair of headphones if you just want to chill and watch Netflix. I feel like I got a lot done while I was on my spare though which is one benefit."
VIllainLife,feadio9,t3_eo50o7,"If youre good at studying for long hours then you should be able to do this. But tbh, if you’ve never had this schedule before i wouldnt recommend it. Your tests will all get piled onto the same day and thats really bad. If you cant change it then you got no choice. When tests come up dont leave it to the last second to study! Study for at least 3 of then 4-5 days in advance and leave 1-2 classes for 1-2 days before. This also goes with staying on-top of your work because studying becomes easier. You wont need to study as hard if you do all the hws on time. 

Tldr: i dont recommend this schedule. But if no choice study for your exams a week in advance because you cant cram for 5 exams in one day."

never_my_cabbages,feagz7o,t3_eo50o7,If you have it easier on other days then I'd say no such problem. You can rest and do work on other days and that one busy day still won't take all off your energy for the week anyways.

melmaster3,feaimma,t3_eo50o7,"I have classes from 11- 9:30 on Monday’s. It’s totally doable. Just do yourself a favor and get a lot of sleep Sunday night. Make sure you get a chance to eat when you have to and take really good notes because your classes can tend to blend together when you’re sitting there for so long. 

The great thing about having a lot of classes on Monday is you have the rest of the week to work on assignments as well as the weekend. Typically you have most of Sunday to cram/ finish stuff up if need be. You’re gonna do great :)"

Good luck."

It definitely is doable. I normally take meal replacement shakes for lunch as well as a snack because I'm back by 7pm to eat dinner at home. I have to trek across campus between every class so that 10min walk is a good way to clear my mind and prepare myself for another 1h15min sitting. If your classes are in the same location, I'd recommend taking a walk in between the courses. Sitting all day is just going to make you tired."

Get through the day however you need to: caffeine, naps, a good note-taking process that keeps you engaged, meditation between classes, whatever.  

What's more important, IMO, will be how you use your time on the *other* days when you aren't in class...it will be very temping to just screw off for days at a time if you don't have classes to attend, and then you'll fall behind and struggle to catch up. Or at least that's what happened to me the first semester I tried it. Later I found that scheduling blocks of study time for specific subjects on my days ""off"" made a huge difference, so I would have  three hours to do history one morning, and two hours for  poli sci in the afternoon, and on another day I'd do calculus in the morning, etc."

Try to avoid peanut based things, lots of people are sensitive to that nowadays and even residue can kill someone. I always have a water bottle on me so I’m not thirsty, and most university or college campuses have little refill stations everywhere.

seth_vangelus,eltgxx,top_level,"Last Spring 2019 I took 18 units (9 classes because I'm a music major) and had to drop 2 courses late in the semester with the help of my assistant dean. I was undergoing severe depression/ptsd/psychosis and was in the process of changing meds because the previous one had weight gain side effects. I lost eligibility for financial aid but they let me do a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal (SAP) which is basically like a probation to regain elgibiltiy:I had to maintain a minimum gpa of 3.0 and pass 75% of the attempted units.

But I ended up not passing the probation. Last Fall 2019 I took 12 units (7 classes) and didn't pass 2 classes (4 units failed). Depression got worse during that time, abusive family situation got worse, my therapist quit and I was stuck with intern therapists that didn't help much, and the new meds I was taking had severe drowsiness side effects and I was hella tired all the time. But it's still on me and I fucked up bad.

This means I'm going to lose my future financial aid and if I want to continue college for another 2 years to be a music teacher, I'm gonna have to pay $3500 semester tuition out of pocket in monthly payments. I couldn't work in 2019 because I didn't have the mental energy to do so and do school full time unlike previous years where I did work part time and do school. I have no fucking idea how I'm gonna be able to manage to work 20 hours a week to pay $700 of tuition a month and attend school at least part time if I couldn't even do school by itself. My dad who was the income earner of the family recently got kidney dialysis and is currently trying to get disability coverage but for now cannot help with those payments. My grandma who's the owner of the house I live in can't help with money either.

I haven't got any notifcation from the financial aid office yet so I'm going there in person today or tomorrow to see what my options are. I can try asking my assistant dean for help but she probably can't do much and I'm also ashamed to ask for her help after telling her early in the Fall semester that I was confident I could pass all this only to end up eating my words as things got worse.

I feel hopeless, and that there is nothing I can do about it, and I can't drop out of college if I want to become a music teacher. I'm absolutely devastated.

TLDR: failed my probationary semester because severe depression/ptsd and now will lose all my financial aid and don't know how I'm going to pay off semester tuition if I want to continue school for another 2 years.

Edit1: I should mention that I'm a 4th year and did a complete medical withdrawal in my 2nd year using notes from my therapist and doctor and was on an SAP for the first time and got out of it. I did well for a year after that til 2019 when I changed my meds and shit went loose. I was able to do this SAP appeal the 2nd time in 2019 because I had documents from my therapist and doctor and assistant dean. I knew since long ago I'd be here for more than 4 years and I don't mind taking longer it's just the hassle with year round music classes and music classes that have to be taken chronological order. It's just the financial aid part I'm worried about. Military isnt an option because I take antidepressants and you can't be on those if you wanna join military. And also I live in southern California in a CSU school."

owner_of_goldens,fdkdsqi,t1_fdk5ze3,"I second this. My depression was terrible in the spring 2019 semester so I did a “withdrawal for extenuating circumstances” and they required a letter from my doctor/therapist and a personal statement from myself.

Trying to bury this is not going to work and it's going to come right back up if you do not address it. 

School will always be available to you. Don't make it harder for yourself by failing and not putting in your all. Take a break and figure yourself out for a little bit."
WhopperitoJr,fdk9rcx,t3_eltgxx,"I know my university, and I would assume most others, allowed you to take a leave of absence wherein you do not have to register for classes but do not have to re-apply to the university (you maintain enrollment but don't pay at least most of the fees).  As others have said, I would say suspending your college education while sorting out your mental health, obtaining a new therapist, and finding a treatment regimen that has manageable side effects is the best course for you. To be very honest, if there was difficulty with just the academic/mental health aspects and if you have not made significant changes or progress in the reasons you had trouble, it is unlikely that piling financial, further mental, and family issues on top will make it much easier. Again, this does not necessarily mean dropping out.

Your post mentions that you have two years of schooling left. Does this mean you've completed the gen ed requirements for your program of study? If not, I would suggest taking and transferring those credits at a community college. That will alleviate some financial burden and if you are able to focus and succeed in those courses, you'll hopefully build a case to continue at your university or, at the very least, the personal confidence to return and succeed.

Lastly, please know that every year, there are other people who find themselves in the same or similar situation as you. You're not alone. While this is an obstacle you must overcome, it is not insurmountable, and taking a break will not preclude you from becoming a music teacher. After all, if you're a school board looking to hire a teacher, one that took a break and came back and excelled would look a lot better than someone who barely made it through, at least in my opinion. Best of luck to you!"
shadowwolfsl,fdk4gmv,t3_eltgxx,Have you gotten help for your mental health?
Bodidiva,fdk8xzl,t3_eltgxx,"This all sounds very difficult to deal with and I'm sorry to hear you are going through it. If it were me, I would do as you plan to see what options are available for the FA and go to the Dean because there is no shame to be had. They are there to help and if you are honest with them, they can best see how to help. 

If there are no options for FA for 2 years,  I'd consider not taking a full course. Take one or two classes to stay in the groove of going to class and chipping away at your education. I'd look for a part time low stress job that I don't have to ""care"" too much about. Something that I can forget about once I leave the job. 

Best of luck and perseverance to you."
Atyree09,fdkscsa,t3_eltgxx,"I left college because of my mental health and it was the best thing I’ve ever done. Became an assistant manager for a coffee shop and had fun. Then I got married and had two children. Three years later, I decided to go back and got three A’s in the first quarter. My GPA is now almost a 3.0.

There is no shame in taking time for yourself and your health. You can reassess after and decide what the right path is for you. I held a lot of shame for my past decisions, but I’ve come to terms with it. Having open communication with your advisors, dean, etc. is so important. I didn’t and now I have to apply for re-admission to my former university."
PM_ME_UR_CPA_NOTES,fdkvpkq,t3_eltgxx,"This thread makes me really sad. I was in a similar position last semester and if i had this many people telling me to just quit, i wouldn’t be where i am now. 

Let me start by just telling you what i did because it might help. If you are not in a fixed tuition plan it’s cheaper for you to take less class. Even if you’re part time, your aid would get prorated. I decided to do school at the minimum full time requirement (4 classes/ 12 hours) and worked 20-30 hours a week. The job i found isn’t anything fancy but it is very accommodating. If your curious, search up if there are any rental event staff in your area. You get to pick up shifts where ever there’s one available, and you’re extra support so no one expects anything from you lol and + most events are on the weekend.

If finishing school is important to you, DO NOT GIVE UP. You can push through this. There are options before dropping out. I cannot tell you how many times i almost dropped out last semester. I spent weeks crying in the assistant deans office because of the stress and depression. But i pushed through it. And I’m so so proud of myself for it. If you know you are capable do not let everyone tell you to just drop out. Your tuition is not expensive. It is manageable. 

Taking less classes will allow you to focus on doing well in them and you can get aid back for next year. You shouldn’t beat yourself up if you do have to take a break from school, but recognize you are strong enough and capable of doing anything. If taking a break is best for you because you know in a few years you’ll be back to finish it with flying colors, then all the love to you. But i remember when i was feeling like this post and it was the depression and anxiety talking."
LowKeyVelmaBabe,fdkd10r,t3_eltgxx,"Hey! I was in the same situation as you! Focus on your mental health before you do anything else. Do not settle for interns if they aren’t helping. Is there a reason why you need to stay in contact with your abusive family? If not, cut them out of your life is the second step. Trust me, I was there too. If you do this step, your life will be a 99999999 times better. Take a gap year. I was kicked out during my finals of my first semester, so I was unable to turn in any projects, so I bombed because of my parents. The second year was because I was the same as you. You are severely depressed and burnt out as I was. You need a break from school, and then come back. 
Lastly, find a job that will suit you for the year. Don’t do what I did and settle for a porn shop job and then work at a daycare six months later. Try to get a nice office job! 

Go on an journey! ❤️"
ClassyHotMess,fdkk4ti,t3_eltgxx,"I lost my financial aid one semester due to something like this. I ended up taking out a personal student loan inside of doing it through the government. The interest rates are very high, and it ended up costing a lot more after school but honestly I think it was worth it in the end. That semester I got my grades up to what they needed to be and was able to get my financial aid back the next semester to continue. 

Although I still struggled I think that it helped me a lot. I knew getting a degree was something important to me, and I couldn’t really afford out of pocket. 

I think honestly you need to consider all your options, it sounds like your situation might be a little more intense then mine was so maybe taking a semester off can help you regroup and get on the correct meds that can help you in the long run! 

There is no shame in putting yourself first, always remember that! You and your mental health is the most important thing. School and work will always be there! Keep us updated on what happens!"
sadxtortion,fdl6fdz,t3_eltgxx,"That’s crazy that you lost your financial aid status, iirc you needed to school at least half time to get a portion of it. Honestly, your only options will be to get a job or look in to grants/scholarships/loans. If you’re able to come up with a plan that’s great but you need to talk to your school about it, only they can help you."
drakirby,fdlfleb,t3_eltgxx,"a lot of schools have some sort of petition for extreme situations such as yours (for example, i work at the registrar's office at my university and we have a petition to the administrative board). they basically look over your personal statement and you can include references from professors and even include medical documentation and they decide whether or not your situation merits action to help you.

i would also consider taking a leave of absence until you feel stable enough to continue your education. your mental health is ultimately the most important.

dm me if you have any questions or just wanna talk :)"
HugeRichard11,fdka6by,t3_eltgxx,"Have you tried appealing by the financial aid department as they would be more knowledgeable about it.

Sounds like you don't have the best environment outside of school to support you so you might want to take it easy and take a leave of absence for the semester while you work things out. This benefits you because you're still in the schools system and can utilize their resources compared to just dismissing yourself."
WriggleNightbug,fdlpf7y,t3_eltgxx,"First, speak with your fnancial aid office.  They probably have a petition for you to appeal the SAP decision.  Secondly, reach out to a doctor for treatment.

If you amhave uses the TEACH grant and are taking a sabbatical, reach out to government so your grant remains a grant.

Another option is attending half time while working. This is a harder options and will cost more in fees, but would keep your loans out of repayment."
yogurtcousin,fdlqvjk,t3_eltgxx,That happened to me. Talk to your advisor. There are ways to protect your financial aid.
Inkelywinkely,fdlrcma,t3_eltgxx,"I wrote a letter, submitted it for 'extenuating circumstances' and sent to the people over my probation when this happened to me. They took the W off my transcripts and I kept the A from the courses I kept. This saved my butt."
PapiGrande7,fdkdsfs,t3_eltgxx,Military
This_is_your_mind,fdkrr8c,t3_eltgxx,"Assuming you can't work things out with the dean, here are your options:

\- Work and go to school

In 5 years, you will probably have a degree and be teaching. You will have probably be broke starting out, in debt if you can get loans.

\- Work w/o school until you can afford it

In 5 years, you will probably have a degree and be teaching. You will hopefully have some money saved up. Probably won't be in debt, because you saved up. You will have had some time to learn how to manage stress and persevere. 

But instead of making assumptions, go and talk to the assistant dean. You may think that you're in a worse situation because you previously asked for help, but that actually puts you in a better situation. It shows that you care about your education, and understand that there are consequences to your actions, and you're willing to seek help."
apl2291,fdkptf5,t1_fdkmdmc,"This is a bit misleading.  I believe you mean “substitute teacher” as any teaching position would require a bachelors and a credential program.  In California, a student with X amount of units under their bachelor degree can take the CBEST and become a 30-day emergency substitute teacher.  They are not a teacher, but only a temporary sub."
uglybutterfly025,fdkqzh8,t1_fdkptf5,hm but it would still be worth checking out cause then OP can substitute teach to make some money and take some classes (many can be done online)

metal_bulb,fdz2rbi,t3_end0e2,"You can always let the professor know your situation. However, this may not mean physical seats but rather an enrollment cap on number of students.

thebakinggoddess,entcf9,top_level,"I grew up very poor, the kind of poor where you have to heat water on the stove to take a bath because you can’t afford to pay the water bill that month.

This semester I’m studying abroad in Italy. I’m in a beautiful, historic apartment with 5 other suburban middle class girls.

It’s seriously shocking to hear nothing but complaints about Italy from some of them. Our apartment doesn’t have a dryer, that’s the end of the world apparently. We can’t use all the outlets at once or the circuit blows, they act like we’re being asked to live in medieval times. One of the girls was yelling at her phone “I’m american!! I’m ah-mer-i-cannnn” because amazon.it kept loading in...Italian. Oh boo hoo! Sorry you can’t buy your €90 hair dryer!

It would be tacky to call them out on their privilege and it probably wouldn’t do anything but at the same time it’s really hard to share a space with people who are so in-your-face spoiled about some things. How do you live with people when it’s so hard to relate to them?"
Travis3481,fe4vkc3,t3_entcf9,"Situations like that can be challenging in your position, for sure. But the flip side of the coin is that you are able to enjoy the experience of living in another environment without focusing on the lack they are perceiving. Their attachment to excess has deprived them of recognizing the joy in the beauty of living in another culture. Perhaps you can help show them that happiness is often in the simplicity of life when we choose to focus on it, rather than what’s not there (a dryer, etc). Best of luck to you and hope you have a great semester!"
thebakinggoddess,fe4vueg,t1_fe4vkc3,That’s a fantastic way to look at it! Thanks so much!
Travis3481,fe4vzvq,t1_fe4vueg,My pleasure! : )
Karakov,fe5sjcu,t3_entcf9,"> How do you live with people when it’s so hard to relate to them?

Just co-exist, living with somebody doesn't mean you have to be friends with them. There are tons of people who are just acquaintances with their roommates. If you do truly find them unbearable, it'd be best for all parties to keep contact to the minimum necessary to get by."
bestfunny2,fe62y45,t3_entcf9,"this happened to me freshman year in an all girls dorm. They all went to private schools and I went to a small country school. I overheard a conversation where they discussed how rich I was or was I pretending to be poor.

Needless to say, I tried to keep my head low but these girls were a bit crazy and made me miserable. Luckily by then the year was over and I never had to be around them again. I was so relieved to find other girls who were more my type and background who I became friends with after that."
1Wittgenstein1,fe73z6u,t3_entcf9,"Growing up, you had running water from a tap and I'm guessing a flush toilet too. I once lived for a year in a place where the water came from a well. We had to walk half a kilometer (500 yards or so) sling the two pails full of water onto a bamboo pole and bring it back to the house. That's really heavy, hurts the shoulders if you're not used to it. The only food in the hot season was fermented fish, boiled rice and insects (and limitless quantities of mangoes which ended up giving me brutal stomach problems).

The thing is that they are not used to a world with no dryer as maybe you would not be used to a world without running water and flush toilets. The real problem is the attitude not the privilege. Most of us have privilege to some degree or other. The question is how we take on the world when we don't have those privileges and what we make of the people and places that are different to our comfort zone.

Right now, you are doubly out of your comfort zone. You are in a foreign country with ""alien"" room mates. I guess the best thing is to learn from both and try not to judge."
lovecheyanne23,fe61sm1,t3_entcf9,"Just remember your only responsible for your own feelings. It may be frustrating but focus on the gratitude you feel for your opportunities.

Laurasaur28,fe6i955,t3_entcf9,"Sounds like my study abroad experience!

Classmate: “I spent too much at the pub last night. I’ll ask my mom to put more money in my account.”

Ignore their privilege and be selfish— you are abroad for YOU. Do what you want. Do what is fulfilling and valuable for you. There are always going to be people in life who have things easier because of their wealth. Those people will have a very hard time adapting to anything but the lives they are used to. You do not have that problem. 

Good luck! Enjoy your time in Italy— it’s a beautiful country with delicious food."
ep1c-d0g-m0n3y,fe6jyp3,t3_entcf9, I lived in the Dominican Republic for a year and I had culture shock... when I moved back to the US.

I can’t wait to go back and I hope you can get through the shock and enjoy Italy!
TytaniumBurrito,fe6pupe,t1_fe6jyp3,I feel the same way when I got back to Mexico on vacations. My cousins seem a lot happier and are way more fun to be around than my friends here in the states. And they could only dream of buying something like the newest Iphone or be able to spend 5 dollars on a starbucks coffee.
bubblegumpandabear,fe6kh4a,t3_entcf9,"My freshman roommate was constantly buying things. Our dorm was super old and falling apart (literally black mold coming out of the sinks and bugs in the water fountain but it is what it is) but in exchange, since it used to be for soldiers, we had our own sink to share and we each had a small closet. You could walk into the closet- it was tiny, but definetly possible. She brought and then bought so many clothes over the year that her closet was completely full. She lofted her bed and had four plastic dressers stacked front to back, and she used her study desk and chair as a spot to put more plastic dressers for clothes. It was insanity. 

She'd constantly go out and buy clothes to destroy for a frat party. She once went and got rather expensive nice white clothing (shirt, hairband, shoes, pants, and socks) just to rip them up and cover them in red paint for a ""red paint party"". She had white shoes ready, too, but she'd worn them at the last frat party and was annoyed that they smelled like beer so she got new ones. I get you, OP. I may not have been as poor as you were, but my parents were definetly financially conscious and very frugal. So watching her mess go down was an eye opener.

 She was also out of state, and only went to our university for the football culture. Like I'm not a fan of football but I feel like you can find football culture in any university, especially one closer than literally across the USA. I don't want to give away her identity, but I realized how rich she was when she told me, and then proved, that her best friend growing up married a very wealthy prince and now spent her life traveling the world with him. And this was like, normal to this girl. She was sad she chose college instead of travelling like her friend."

Sraniale,febtcxu,t1_feagqj6,"I'm taking Stats I and II in the spring since they don't offer the first one in the winter! Well thank you for your advice, I was asking myself ""do I need this unnecessary stress?"" and that helps with my answer."
MyBlueSunshines,fe55ng7,t3_enrdiv,"I'm getting as much of the other stuff I need to do this week out of the way.  Major spring cleaning, cooking, paying bills, binging tv, etc.  This will free up my week so I can get a good start on the semester."
TinyDino425,fe5tm4c,t3_enrdiv,I'm legit the same way. I have a week left and I'm like trying to relax to a point where I'm stressed about not prepping and stressed about not relaxing.
Haarp_1,fe6kite,t3_enrdiv,By taking a mad shit and drinking the night before classes
SpirituallyUgly,fe7sqo7,t3_enrdiv,Lowkey crying now so I don't have to cry later in the semester
tiNsLeY799,fe5i1tf,t3_enrdiv,"bruh i got unenrolled from one of my classes and i just saw the email Thursday. it says it was send Tuesday, and I responded to it and I'm anxious for nothing and haven't checked back. now im scrambling to enroll for two classes that fall under my major requirements."
Stokbakko,fe5akq4,t3_enrdiv,I am not even done with last semester yet... last exam on january 25
intoxicatedmidnight,fe5x07m,t1_fe5akq4,good luck!!
TinyBabyAlli,fe5ayhv,t3_enrdiv,"Stress as I try to complete 4 assignments by February 5th, as I'm an online student who works full time and is taking two courses and going on vacation on the 6th - whyyyyyy - my fault though. I'm canadian, I need sun, there is no compromise lol."
givemedasmoke,fe5vbbw,t3_enrdiv,Prepare by getting good sleep.
UseTheTabKey,fe5y0b8,t3_enrdiv,I still have a week. I start on Tuesday
Topazz410,fe6hv4w,t3_enrdiv,anxiety attacks and crying
cityofangels98,fe6j83e,t3_enrdiv,I'm taking an online winter class right now that's a lot of work. I want (kinda need)  a new HP laptop so I'm about to buy that to get ready for the next semester
LordDrox,fe6kemg,t3_enrdiv,"Not a lot of prep to do. I'm starting a new major (Bio) at my local community college after deciding to quit CIS, and aside from making sure I know where/when all my classes are and getting some basic school materials together I've just been trying to relax. 

Leave the stress for the first round of texts and midterms."
Xfelix17,fe5gdcf,t3_enrdiv,Tomorrow I will use it as a day to obtain all my textbooks and access codes etc I’m trying to not stress myself out
