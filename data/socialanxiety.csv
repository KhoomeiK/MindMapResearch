ValtronW,fdrisbi,t3_emst6p,"I'm an odd case. My parents have always been very loving and supportive of me. In fact, my mom often put me in situations where I had to do public speaking, growing up. But I'm just naturally shy and not motivated by people's attention. I've always just naturally preferred to be alone. But being isolated made it so that when I did have to interact with people, it was anxiety-provoking. And I've just never grown out of it ü§∑ But I also struggle with low self-esteem/loathing, so that's part of it too."
measure_my_sleep,fdrlfr5,t1_fdrisbi,Oh yeah I definitely resonate with being shy/preferring to be alone too. Pretty much explains why I have no idea how to act in social situations lol.

""Your son is so quiet and well-behaved!"" 

""Haha, thanks it's the emotional abuse!"""
Vanessa-coffeerun,fds8qjk,t1_fdrde9n,Yup same for me. My earliest memories are of my father screaming at and belittling me for so many things. The physical abuse began at about age 8 and my mother started the screaming and yelling at me a couple of years after. To this day I absolutely break down in tears if anyone yells at me or raises their voice in anger. I‚Äôm very sensitive and years of therapy haven‚Äôt changed that unfortunately.

Throwawayuser626,fdrjm3l,t1_fdri8n6,"Oh, yep. That‚Äôs exactly my experience too. (Well mine got physical sometimes but it was rare).

KungFuHamster,fdrpyv2,t1_fdrjm3l,"I never had a father figure. My mother was married for a few years, but my ""stepfather"" was more like just a guy that lived with us. He was more friendly than my mother, really, but we were never close.

My brother was cold and unfriendly, resentful of me. He said I had it easier than he did, so he took it out on me by never forming that sibling bond I've read about and seen on TV. He was always vaguely angry. That may be somewhat normal for older siblings, but when it's all you get, it just amps up the anxiety even further. 

I loved to read, for example, but I never had enough books. He kept his books in his room in dresser drawers, and his room was off limits. Just to show how spiteful and dysfunctional our relationship was.

My whole extended family was superficial and cold and sarcastic, so there was never any relief. No doting grandparents (alcoholic distant grandfather we rarely saw), no teachers who reached out to ask how things were, etc."
has-some-questions,fdrejow,t3_emst6p,I have nervous ticks and I finally asked my mom when they started. She said I had them since I was a toddler. Sooo.... Pretty sure it was because I lived in an extremely violent house and constantly watched my dad beat up my mom. Lol üòÖ

hamfisted_postman,fdroour,t3_emst6p,"For me, it was a witch's curse. This happened the summer I turned 11. She came down from the hill one day and almost beat my dog to death. All she got was a $100 fine, our vet bills and 10 months probation. I spent the whole summer staring at her house from my yard until one day I got the guts to walk up there. If was a few years older I might have pulled her out of her house and stomped her to death in the street or burned down her house but all I did was yell at her from the road. ""You almost killed my dog."" ""You should have gone to jail."" I was angry but too young to know what to do with the anger. She came into her yard and said something to me. I didn't recognize the words but something changed. 

Since that day I've been fighting social anxiety. Medication helps but I spend a lot of time alone. It's easier this way. I want friends and a romantic relationship but everytime I get close I go into a deep panic. I have a job but I'm the only guy in my department, delivering mail and transferring documents in a major hospital. I can't even get a word out to the people I see day to day. They all think I'm mute. The only reason I think that posting here is possible is because I don't know who or what is seeing these words."

I'm also always surprised when she's in a good mood, but that may be because she works all day."
Thy_Introvert,fdsb1ji,t3_emst6p,"I actually found out where mine came from cuz of my therapist. Basically I was telling her my childhood (specifically talking about my dad cuz apparently i never talked about him at all) and how my dad wasn‚Äôt really a dad (alcoholic, short-tempered with almost _anything_, emotionally abusive, etc.) and how my dad would always yell at me for talking/saying things and how he‚Äôd never listen to me. And the fact he was barely ever around cuz he was working or drinking. That‚Äôs just a summed up version of it tho. 

And my therapist was like ‚Äúyou know, from what you told me, it sounds like your social anxiety started when all that with your dad started happening‚Äù or something like that and it was like one of those ‚ÄòOhh!‚Äô moments cuz it was literally true. I used to be social and approaching others without a care (and having friends that weren‚Äôt only just my pets), but it dwindled away and was replaced with doubts and anxiety because of my dad and his treatment towards me and my siblings. Then the doubts grew to the ‚Äúwhat if people don‚Äôt actually like me?‚Äù and ‚Äúare they just pretending to be my friend?‚Äù and cuz of that i kinda lost my friends- though it didn‚Äôt seem like they cared all that much cuz they pretty much started ignoring me around the last two years of being friends. So yeah, it all started cuz of my dad, which isn‚Äôt surprising :/

Started with a cinema club watching movies with people and then going for dinner after. Once I developed some trust with new friends I was honest when I was anxious which helped when it was really bad. The more I do it the more confident I get and the more new things I do.

Anytime we would play with our friends, she would make me feel like I was the odd one out or the weird one of the group. 

On top of that, I‚Äôve always been different from my family, so my parents would try to do the same thing. They reinforced the idea that what I had to say or what I believed didn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs not like that anymore now that I‚Äôm older (I‚Äôm 24), but growing up I always felt like sharing with others or making friends would lead to something bad. Then because I was quiet and was afraid of making friends when I got to middle school, I became target for bullies. And because I had the belief growing up that I couldn‚Äôt share how I felt, I never told anyone, including my parents, about the bullying. It‚Äôs like one thing lead to another thing that lead to my social anxiety becoming so much worse.

When I was 13 nobody showed to the birthday party even though I invited 50 kids.

When I was 16 we have a class project and were told to pair up and when the teacher asked another student to pair up with me since no-one else would he yelled loudly ""I'd rather walk in front of a train"" and the whole class laughed.  I remember that one vividly for some reason.

It's been rough."
szatanna,fdy5i4p,t1_fdw541w,"Ugh, i feel you! I was also the ""undesirable"" one when teachers told us to pair up. Specially when whe had P.E. as I was the fat kid. No one ever wanted me to be in their teams."

MoonUnit98,fdrwax5,t3_emst6p,"I‚Äôm pretty sure I already had anxiety at this point, but my parents would sometimes get a kick out of embarrassing me. It was nothing more than lighthearted stuff any other parent would do, but they‚Äôd sometimes see my reaction and tell me I needed to lighten up. And that‚Äôs really what bothered me. They were probably right that I needed to lighten up, yet never stopped to think that maybe there was a reason for it. Even when they did realize it, they didn‚Äôt know how to help lol 

I remember when I was like 15 or 16, my mom was super adamant about me getting a slushee at the movie theater, even though I told her I didn‚Äôt want one. We went back and forth for at least a minute about this damn slushee, and I was beyond embarrassed doing this in front of the cashier. I finally told her to just get one, and asked her what the hell that was all about and she goes, ‚Äúwell, sometimes you need to be pushed into doing things‚Äù. And that‚Äôs the story about how my mom tried to cure my social anxiety with a slushee. It didn‚Äôt work and the slushee tasted like ass, just like I expected."

WhySoQuiet36,fdsdbk9,t3_emst6p,"Verbal bullying in elementary contributed a great deal to my anxiety. Unlike physical bullying its never taken seriously by the authorities. I'm just told to ignore them or their just jealous of me because of being the smart kid (and for having weird interests) in class. But it's easier said than done. The feeling of being unwelcome is a bad feeling. I felt people either had great respect for me but never being friends with anyone  or outright hated me. I bet rumors about me spread then.

Bullying ended in high school but was constantl depressed on top of the anxiety. Things got better eventually but still socially anxious. Learning to demolish the walls of mistrust I put up to be able to genuinely connect with others."

1. My mom and dad‚Äôs answer to everything was yelling and whippings. Plus constantly hearing shut up and I hate you from them a lot.



2. Growing up poor and not having (or caring for) nice things and clothes among other things opened me up for bullying. Even today at work.



3. On a funny note. I had to rap in front of class. Something about estuaries or something.



4. Skateboarding and falling where I lived was a nightmare.


There is so much more than four."
KwameQuaoHoe,fdsqnpk,t3_emst6p,What‚Äôs weird about my social anxiety was that I was a good athlete in high school(even went to college for it) and had a decent friend group in both high school and college.

It‚Äôs better since I stopped drinking but some days I still freeze up when people talk to me.

JustAskBrain,fe5shai,t3_emst6p,"When I was 10 years old, I began to play football with a local team for about a year. I went to countless training sessions and matches against other teams during this time. At the end of the year we had a ceremony in which all families of the team gathered and each player stood in a line on an elevated stage and our coach that had been training us for the entire year started handing out a medal one by one and then somehow (I still don‚Äôt understand how it was possible) he forgot or just didn‚Äôt give me a medal so I just stood there empty handed whilst everyone else in my team were holding their medals up in the air for their families to see and cheering. Then when we walked off the stage and back to our families I remember my friends dad asking me with this worried or almost shocked face ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you get one \[my name\]?‚Äù and I could instantly feel my emotions overwhelming me and I was just like ‚Äúnope‚Äù and I don‚Äôt really remember more from that day, sort of suppressed it. (I just felt betrayed by my teacher which I very much liked and sort of looked up to, I've struggled with SA before that time tho but I think that really helped fuel it.)

TLDR: Was part of a football team (10 years old at the time), coach forgot to give me my medal at end of year when everyone was watching and it ruined me."

Noahakinschode,fdol0ba,t1_fdnx8gi,"I‚Äôve been working on my social anxiety for awhile now. I am not perfect myself, but I want to give my perspective on this line of thinking. I have thought the same thing you‚Äôre thinking a thousand times. The reality of it is 90% of the time you‚Äôre thinking that, the other person is enjoying talking to you while you‚Äôre sitting there thinking ‚Äúomg is he/she interested rn? Am I boring them? I have to make sure I‚Äôm not doing that!‚Äù And the whole time you‚Äôre thinking that, you are stressing yourself out rather than enjoying the company of this person you like. Being able to comfortably converse with someone is not always easy with new people. That‚Äôs normal. It‚Äôs something you can build on over time until you feel comfortable with them. So you‚Äôre probably gonna be nervous, but try to also enjoy this new person whether or not your relationship/friendship lasts. If it doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre putting yourself out there and you should be proud of that even if you fail to get what you want out of it. You are trying even though you‚Äôre scared and I think that‚Äôs awesome. Don‚Äôt put too much pressure on yourself, it‚Äôs gonna be okay."
Das3m,fdp0kf5,t1_fdo0dms,"I agree with this advice. I used to try and formulate an interesting/engaging response in my head whilst the other person was talking and when it came to me actually responding I would end up saying something very basic like ‚Äúoh yes, that‚Äôs interesting, tell me more‚Äù and then I might change the topic because I didn‚Äôt know what else to say. It made my conversations jagged and not flowing. 

I started practising the idea of trusting my brains ability to respond. It‚Äôs similar to the way I would respond when I‚Äôm half dazed in the morning just after waking up, all the in head conversations were not in full speed. And so I slowly began to release myself of the conversations I was having in my head and started to listen. I would reassure myself that it didn‚Äôt matter if what I said was boring and non engaging, this practise was in the name of self improvement and one day I‚Äôll naturally become more interesting. In terms of topics, I found it easiest to talk about aspects of life, I was not very good at banter and still am not. When I‚Äôm in a good mood I can make people laugh and have an engaging conversation for hours. Like 2-3 hours, that‚Äôs amazing for me. I know realise the energy I put into a conversation is the energy I get out of the conversation. I also realised by eating healthy, sleeping well,  and doing exercise I can increase my energy levels. I now have no problem striking up a conversation with a random person I just met, sitting at the bus stop or waiting to get a hair cut. I still have progress to make, I just want you all to know it gets better as long as you keep trying. If you give up you‚Äôll be the same in 10+ years. I made this progress in 2 years"

Ahren_with_an_h,fdk71s6,t1_fdk38pn,"The problem is that you believe it would matter if they did care, that if people notice you at all it's bad. The story for why it's bad (fat, eat weird, walk weird, whatever) isn't relevant. It's just nonsense we make up to justify the feeling. The problem is we believe the feeling. We believe and react to it over and over and over again programming our nervous system that not being noticed is critically important training ourselves to have more and more anxiety in social situations.

Surrender to being noticed. Do it over and over again. That's the way out of this."
ohsnapt,fdkj5af,t1_fdk38pn,"I mean I get it I used to feel it intensely . But How often do you think about that towards others. And what is the consequences of those thoughts, nothing they never know

They might be thinking ""nice shirt"" or "" I'm so horny I need a date"" or ""maybe that person could be my date"" 

People look at people for all reasons and just as quickly forget about them"
ohsnapt,fdkjeez,t1_fdk71s6,"This is fact. I spent a long time practicing by going to nightclubs by myself, talking to no one, and just simply  taking up space there. It helped that it was loud and I could hide in the dark"
Throwawayuser626,fdkqack,t1_fdkj5af,Lmao okay but literally no one looks at me as a potential date or that they‚Äôre horny. That‚Äôs kinda part of the problem is I‚Äôm very ugly (I‚Äôve been told this to my face multiple times) and people do stare at me because they‚Äôre rude. I guess I look weird so they‚Äôre trying to figure me out.
Ahren_with_an_h,fdkkn2z,t1_fdkjeez,Taking up space. That's a good way to put it.
ohsnapt,fdm5i5d,t1_fdkqack,"i mean whether that is true or not, you are still allowed to throw out apple cores ;) 

people look at me all the time. Maybe because i am distinctive or maybe another reason i dont know. I have no idea if i am being judged or not, and i will never find out most of the time. And most importantly it is irrelevant. i've heard a quote that says ""what people think of you is none of your business"""
Kelter_Skelter,fdk840p,t3_elp28w,Sitting there for 5 minutes after you threw away the apple core trying to breathe and act normally as the anxiety grips you like the darkness and adrenaline courses around your system before subsiding and you feel like a whole event just happened to you at which point someone looks at you and they wonder why you're clenching your fists so tight and also still wearing your jacket
depressive_anxiety,fdjx2ux,t3_elp28w,Or refusing to eat the apple during a meeting with a bunch of people watching you to begin with
_theblindside_,fdjn9v4,t3_elp28w,Do you think it's anxiety or you are just hyper aware of every move/desicion you make? I'm very similar but I see it as a good quality for certain things to overthink and be incredibly self-aware. Exhausting for sure and I wish I could shut it off but I believe it makes me successful
Ahren_with_an_h,fdk6r3r,t1_fdjn9v4,"It's a fear of being noticed because of a deep sense of low self-worth.

Over-thinking is reacting to feelings. Thinking in depth about something is fine. Being too reactive to feelings is bad because then they control and torment you as above."

MaikRak,fdkaqeq,t3_elp28w,Pretty brave to eat an apple during a meeting all the apple juice could drop on you and then you look like some kind of toddler or something
may0negg,fdkr9fr,t3_elp28w,"One time I was presenting my thesis research at a big chemistry meeting and it was one of those situations where you sit in front of a poster board of your work and everyone walks around and asks you questions. This guy who was definitely flirting with me came up and gave me a can of soda as a ‚Äúhang in there‚Äù type gesture (I had like an hour of sitting left at this point). I‚Äôm allergic to high fructose corn syrup and thus couldn‚Äôt drink said soda, but I didn‚Äôt want to make him feel bad so instead of telling him like a normal person, I thanked him for it and then hid it behind my poster after he left... my friends were very confused by the soda when I pulled it out at the end and tried of pawn it off on one of them."
LocalFreak,fdku95j,t3_elp28w,And after feeling all proud for yourself you look down at your hands and realize in horror that you were so nervous you forgot to actually throw it away and now have to hide it since you can‚Äôt get up to throw it away again.

So you wait until someone comes and take an apple to go and get one yourself.

LoAdEdPoTaTo281,fe0oz11,t1_fe051vi,I thought the same. Actually came into play recently. I'm in a class and so me and this other person sit to the side of the room. Since their friend had just transferred out of the class they asked if I wanted to move to some seats in the front. I took one look at all the people behind the seats(most of the people around were girls making it worse)and my brain went nope. The thought of having that many eyes stare at me for the whole class was just too much.
Kevraeken,fe2fwu2,t1_fe051vi,"Definitely! Always sitting in the back where no one's watching me. 
Even if I know they're not actively watching me, I'm still super nervous the whole time and think about stuff like ""Am I breathing too much?"" ""Does it look weird if I sit like this or do this movement?"" Sooo annoying"

I don't want other people to hear me use the bathroom and I don't want to hear them either. And where I work there's so many people the stalls are almost guaranteed to be filled. 

But this bathroom has concrete walls on all 3 sides because its in the basement and it's only one stall. Only bathroom out of all 20 in the complex to be like that, and I walk 10 minutes for it. 

Only downsides are poor cell reception and the toilet is older so it breaks down often. And people don't take care of it as well since it's so out of the way."

Maybe you were a well behaved and a quiet kid because you were thinking too much about things and that you used to worry a lot and when you grew up you are still thinking about things too much because you were afraid to do the same mistake you did as a kid when someone also chose the wrong way to tell that this is bad and this is good.

2. She'd come to each group and person all ask the group a question and see how we discuss. 


3. She'd sit beside the group and just watch how we discuss on our own.


We too were graded on how much we talk and added into the discussion. I managed to get a 8/10 (she actually wrote 9 but changed it to 8 lol) but only because I had to force myself to speak when she came to my group. Most HORRIFYING experience ever."

Speaking is just another classroom criteria of which students are putting in the effort. I think the answer to the problem is to inform the teacher of a students anxiety, so they don‚Äôt think they are trying to get away without putting in work.

LearningToBeATeacher,fdnjwjx,t3_em1qd6,"As a future teacher in college and someone who is an introvert/gets socially anxious, I totally get this. I have said this exact stuff a million times in high school. **But here's the thing:** unfortunately, having to talk with others in a discussion is a real critical skill that you need to develop for whatever career you go into in life. 

Reading the comments, I see ppl talking about the Socratic Seminars or ""fishbowls"" that they have to do where they have a limited time to contribute to a discussion with 8-15 other people while everyone else watches them. What I want to be able to do with these types of activities when I start teaching is make those groups smaller. Maybe I'd have one group of 4 or 5 go at a time, in the back of the class, away from the other students, or maybe just in the hallway. I wouldn't have the entire class watch either, they'd be busy with other work. With smaller groups, it would take longer but there'd be less pressure and students would probably perform better as they'd actually have a chance to talk and they wouldn't be in front of a whole class. I know that the normal  ""8-15 students talk in a circle then switch with the other 8-10"" is how these discussions are usually done, but I want to put quality of performance over speed of getting those discussions done."

My face goes red, people notice it, I'm shaking really much etc. Once it's over I don't see it as a success but more as the end of a nightmare... I'll try seeing it differently next time.

2) parents bitch and complain about every little thing ever. This is a ripe idea for them to bitch about. Teachers also do this to say ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt engaging in class even though I try to get them involved.‚Äù

Lipziger,fdmsa10,t3_em1qd6,"I hated this as well and was pretty much panicking when I had to speak in front of the class, BUT it should stay the way it is, since school should not just teach you the stuff on the plan but also behaviour and should prepare you for what comes after.

And the World doesn't give a damn that you're insecure. It will be way harder to get anything done later in life when you never left your bubble. I don't think bursting that bubble too aggressively in school is always good but it has to be done one way or another.

I had a teacher that took a speach test with me every single week. No exception. I won't say I lost my fear entirely but it pushed me to find something to deal with it or go down with it. I hated the teacher at first, but when I left school and even now at nearly 30 I think of him as one of the best teachers I could've had. But then again, he knew how to pull it off without being an ass about it.

And you also have to think about the people with different strengths. Some are very vocal, an active but might lack in other departments. This might be a thing they're looking forward in school and that might help them get through topics or classes that are incredibly hard for them."

helendill99,fdn0o6n,t3_em1qd6,"Problem is you‚Äôre expected to be good at presenting in your future jobs, especially if you are management. While giving bad grades isn‚Äôt the right way to go, schools and universities really need to improve everyone‚Äôs social and presentation skills in the work place if they want their students to go far."
Aziraphale22,fdn3b6w,t3_em1qd6,"I think this is a really complicated issue.

I live in Germany and here, your grade is 50% exams and tests, and 50% participation in class (or at least it was when I was in school). It was hell for me. It caused a lot of anxiety because I knew I had to participate or else my grades would get worse. I loved learning and got really good grades in exams.

But knowing that I NEEDED to talk in class or else I would be in trouble (getting told by every single teacher that this wasn't okay, I needed to talk more, this won't be okay in university - which is bullshit) made me so anxious that I literally could not think of the answers to any questions. It just made my brain stop working, basically.

I think it's important to make it more relaxed for students. I think it's bullshit to just say half of your grade is how much you participate in class. That's not ""fair"" at all. I knew most of the answers, I just froze. Meanwhile, there was a girl in my class who literally asked stupid questions all the time (as in, the teacher explained something, and she asked about that same thing a minute later) and got the best grades as a result. That's not ""fair"", it's just rewarding being loud, and valuing quantity over quality."

LoAdEdPoTaTo281,fe43jr7,t1_fe42pil,It wasn't anything like what you described. But having to go through class for a whole semester was traumatic. It's the only thing I remember from that class. Eventually towards the end some people I guess left so some seats opened up in the back and I casually made my way back there. Not to mention my crush was there and in the first row opposite me.
navmaster,fe44834,t1_fe43jr7,"I see... damn. Having your crush in the class as well sucks, jeez."
LoAdEdPoTaTo281,fe44xve,t1_fe44834,Yeah I dont think I made a good impression on her with all the squirming I did. Now I just recoil whenever I remember. At least it's in the past and over.
navmaster,fe45bqr,t1_fe44xve,"Yes, that‚Äôs a good way of putting it. Every single one, Id try to talk and say something super embarrassing and I‚Äôd keep thinking about that moment anywhere from the next 1-7 days. But recently, I‚Äôve just learned to forget about it because it‚Äôs not like the rest of the students are going to remember that moment for long and in all honesty I‚Äôm just making a huge deal about it for no reason haha."
LoAdEdPoTaTo281,fe46n2w,t1_fe45bqr,"That's more than I ever did.

 That's the thing they tell you but like a lot of things it's easier to say than do. Someone described social anxiety well by saying it just doesn't listen to reason. You can think whatever and tell yourself whatever you want but for whatever reason emotion overrides logic. 

Then again if your crushes do remember then it means something to them and so it isnt that much of a bad thing."

navmaster,fe4yig6,t1_fe4unw8,"Haha me every time. But recently I‚Äôve started going in the inside circle first because if you are the second group, there‚Äôs very little to discuss about since the first group usually goes over the main points for the discussion."

isleeptoolate,fe64r9w,t3_enoacq,"I remember getting the rubric for these discussions and getting a 100 meant you had to speak up at least 4 times. So people would say some bullshit to count for their four, and we‚Äôd side eye the girl who took too many turns because she had no self awareness for the situation. You kept your part short so your pals can get a word in edgewise. That‚Äôs how we looked out for each other."
navmaster,fe8zq6j,t1_fe64r9w,Wow that‚Äôs nice. I wish it was the same case with my classes. Most people just hog the conversation just so they can get their grade better.

navmaster,fe4mb4r,t1_fe3yds0,Yea. I definitely think it‚Äôs a good learning experience for people who enjoy these type of discussions but I think schools should have two options whether to do the discussion or an alternative assignment(typically an essay). That way both sides are satisfied and the people who do not join the discussion can listen in the outside circle and still learn in the process.

And if you don‚Äôt find a BFF, then that‚Äôs fine. I think adult friendships don‚Äôt really work that way unless you‚Äôve known them for a long time.

Malgaras,fdzqpq1,t3_encpj1,"Am I just the odd one out here? I'm thirty now, and in retrospect I absolutely wish people had pushed me to do more social things when I was younger. It would have saved me a lot of time and therapy right now trying to figure out how to do this shit long after everyone else already has it down. Yeah, I would have been uncomfortable, but at the end of the day, there are valuable skills I never got the chance to pick up because I was too busy hiding from the world. I've come to terms with the fact that I made my own choices at the end of the day, but with the benefit of hindsight, I think people pushing me back then would have been doing me a service."
Cidroin,fdzu69r,t1_fdzqpq1,"It‚Äôs like exposure therapy, except you don‚Äôt have a choice."
DizKord,fdzrx3l,t1_fdzqpq1,"There are people with your experience and people like me with the exact opposite experience. I guess the issue is that we're both talking about ideal alternate realities that can never be proven. You can never know for sure if ""being pushed"" would have helped you, and I can never know for sure if not being pushed would have helped me. But I know that being pushed led me to many extremely uncomfortable situations that made me vehemently hate school, and as an adult I still have crippling anxiety. I would love to see a glimpse of the alternate reality where school wasn't a thirteen year long nightmare."
Malgaras,fdzv0on,t1_fdzu69r,"I guess my point is, exposure therapy *is* a thing that has a track record of results, so I find it hard to agree when people write it off like it's some sort of torture. As for having a choice, I had a one opted out, and an not at all convinced it was to me benefit to do so, so idk."
Malgaras,fdzvcyf,t1_fdzrx3l,"Fair enough. For what it's worth, my school years weren't exactly great either. They weren't anxiety filled, but they were extremely lonely and isolating. I just convinced myself it was what I wanted because it was easier, until I got older and could no longer ignore the fact that I wasn't happy, but by then I was playing a massive game of catch up that I'm still playing to this day.

Maybe that's the takeaway: School is shit no matter what you do. Hah."
Hidingmysoul,fe07a38,t1_fdzv0on,"I think the problem is that exposure on it's own can set you back ever further if you don't have good ways of processing all the feelings that it will inevitably bring up when you struggle or fail in some way. To quieten and challenge the negative thoughts those experiences produce you generally need that outside support, which might not always be readily available when your younger."
Cidroin,fdzv4u2,t1_fdzv0on,I agree with you

elegantmushroom,fdzy08s,t3_encpj1,"Yeah. I think many of them mean well when they do this, since exposure therapy does really work. But it has to be done in a safe, controlled fashion and most classroom settings don't allow for this. Especially when grades are on the line. People are supposed to start small and work their way up to doing the most anxiety-inducing things, but classes like this force people into the deep end immediately. And that can definitely make people worse. Especially if, as a result of their anxiety, they end making the very mistakes they were afraid of making."

TechSis,fdzwkse,t3_encpj1,"Also a teacher- Theatre to be specific. I don‚Äôt force any of my students to put themselves out there- but I do encourage them to overcome their doubts. I try to create a classroom they feel safe enough to explore who they are with people that support them. I try to equip them with tools that will help them manage this anxiety they feel, to acknowledge that it is real but give them a sense of control of it. So if that earns me a special place in hell, i guess that‚Äôs where I am going."

Vashtita-Self-Love-,fdhsv6b,t3_eleeki, Become your own favourite person.
missthatfaaace,fdi8b9h,t1_fdhsv6b,fall in love with yourself. a very important thing that i still need to figure out how to do
allofthisisbullshit,fdig0kn,t1_fdhsv6b,so very difficult when so many things I love to do involve other people ... and a lot of those people are selfish (theater... egos... ugh)
Y6Y1Y9,fdix1c4,t1_fdhsv6b,Humans crave other positive human interaction. Being your own favorite person doesn't really have any impact on that. It's like telling someone who doesn't have a job to hire themself or give themself a job. Like yeah it sounds all cute and positive on paper but it's not an actual solution to the fact that they have bills due next month and no income.
Vashtita-Self-Love-,fdjdulc,t1_fdix1c4,"No not in the job scenario but becoming your own face our Ute person is completely different.  Speaking from personal experiences by the way, not just saying it because it may ‚Äúsound cute‚Äù. It‚Äôs real or at least was very real for me. I guess it all comes down to ones perception of being your own best friend is and entails. 

The more of a relationship you develop with yourself, the less reliant you become on the validation and acceptance of others. That‚Äôs facts. You‚Äôre able to let go of expectation and attachment and so how other people act/act towards you ceases to affect you to such a high degree.  There is absolutely no real reason to seek or wish to be somebody‚Äôs favourite person and positive human interactions are more likely to develop once that expectation is removed. 

That way of thinking all stems from a place of feeling inadequate, as if you don‚Äôt measure up. Once you realise that you are indeed more than enough, many areas of your life will be influenced. You‚Äôll think and behave differently, your self concept will reflect in your actions and the way you show up in the world and as a result you will begin to attract the right people into your life. 

If I‚Äôm so desperately seeking with a connection with another, I will come into contact with leeches who just take from me and drain me.

If However I seek a deeper connection with myself, I will grow and develop as a person, I will start speaking up when necessary, I will stop settling for less and begging overeating at my highest version which will eventually and inevitably attract like minded people who I can develop a positive and sustainable relationship with."
Y6Y1Y9,fdjdyz9,t1_fdjdulc,"I don't agree. You can have a great relationship with yourself and still want to have a best friend who you are also their best friend. Or someone who you are their favorite or however else it can be put. The two aren't necessarily linked. It's not a one can't happen without the other thing. The relationship with yourself doesn't make up for the lack of one with others or vice versa. Nor does having a healthy relationship with yourself magically make healthy relationships with others happen like unlocking the door to another room. People need both a healthy relationship with themselves, but also with others, in order to survive. One can attain either without the other, in any order. That is also facts. It's not about being desperate for validation or expectations, it's just having your basic human needs met. And that doesn't happen if you pick one over the other when you need both."
Vashtita-Self-Love-,fdjpk5u,t1_fdjdyz9,"My comment doesn‚Äôt dispute that. I never said that there wouldn‚Äôt be a want or need for a friendship with others and I‚Äôm not saying to pick one over the other. There most definitely is a direct link between the two though. One affects the other. That doesn‚Äôt mean that you won‚Äôt encounter negativity in relationships but it the levels will be a lot less and the way one feels a out the situation and is able to productively deal with it shall improve dramatically. 

From my experience and the experience of those I‚Äôve encountered and mentored, a truly healthy relationship with self has inspired fruitful and healthy relationships with others. 

I just want to reiterate that I‚Äôm saying this all from both personal and professional experience. 

When we look at and study the six  human needs, all of those needs are not on the same level and wanting to be someone‚Äôs favourite person, that need for significance is on the lower end.  I‚Äôm not disregarding a need for love a connection, that will always be valid but there is no reason anyone should be actively seeking to be someone‚Äôs favourite person."
allofthisisbullshit,fdifuh8,t3_eleeki,"Yes and no. Remember, your brain is lying to you.  Yes - you should distance yourself from poison. No - you should not distance yourself from everyone just because some people are assholes. The truth is, most people are caught up in their own little worlds and don't even know what you're going through in yours. It's not that you're not their favorite person. It's that they're probably not thinking about you at all. That's the tough part. I keep trying to open up and trust people, and then inevitably, someone takes advantage of that, so I want to just shut down and shut everyone out completely. It's a vicious cycle. I'm sorry for anybody else going through it. It sucks."
DJGuy15455,fdiu4dx,t1_fdifuh8,"I just don‚Äôt want to open up because I don‚Äôt want to be a burden to people, and I want to help them instead of them helping me"

Tutilio,fdycvvh,t3_emz1fe,I think a better meme would be to show that the situation is exactly the same regardless and the only thing different is perception. So maybe show  some guy walking down the street normally and then some guy who thinks that people are watching him. I still understand how powerful the feeling is that people are judging but the reality of things doesn‚Äôt really change it‚Äôs just perception.
Reitanna,fdykmrg,t1_fdycvvh,"i wanted the perception to be first person because the creepy feeling is when they're looking at you, not someone else. changing the perception to third person would make you feel like you're imagining someone else being stared at. it completely defeats the purpose of showing social anxiety. that's also why they all have wide, blank eyes. the person viewing the picture needs to feel unnerved and freaked out so that they understand somewhat how we feel. i mean, anyone with social anxiety would know and understand this."

_Porinju_,feczgzt,t1_fecz11e,Can you elaborate please?
daedio,feczzrb,t1_feczgzt,"AvPD is very similiar to social anxiety disorder (in fact, many experts claim that it's a severe version of SAD), but the main difference is that you're unable to have an intimate relationship (either friendship or romantic relationship) with anyone, because of huge trust problems, even though you crave it and you feel anxious in all social situations, whereas SAD concers certain social situations. Moreover, with AvPD you have usually low self-esteem and you know your fears are true, while with SAD you know they're irrational. In fact, SAD is very often diagnosed simultaneously with AvPD. From my personal experience, I had a lot of situations where I wanted to get to know some people (online, not in real life) and once I did, I wanted to end the relationship for no reason - I just thought they didn't like me as much as I did them and I couldn't trust them, etc. There are relatively few articles describing AvPD, look it up on wiki and other sites you find if you want which I strongly recommend. It explained a lot of my weird behaviours that SAD didn't. Lastly, AvPD is a personality disorder which by its definition means it's way harder to overcome and may even stick with you through your entire life"
